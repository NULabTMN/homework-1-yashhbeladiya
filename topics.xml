A BLOCKADE AT THE MEW-YORK AUCHORAGE
P08UED AND FORCKD DOWN THK BHORT FLIGHT
OF BTAIKS-A OBF.AT HEAP OF DEAD AND
WOCNDED-HEABTRENDINO t-C?XE8 AT THE
HOSPITALS.
A terrible disaster occurred yesterday after?
noon on tho East River Bridge, by which
twelve persons lost their lives and a great
*B_ny othern were injured more or less seriously.
While there were no less than l.r>,000
larsons on the Bridge, a blockade was formed
cn the footpath at the head of a
flight of steps niue feet high extending
from the masonry above the anchorage to the
fh.st iron true*, the same place at which block?
ade-, of i*eople have occurred heretofore.
A panie followed the pushing and struggling
liv which men and women tried to free thein
?elvis from the crowd. In the midst of
this rush, started, lt is thought by a gang of
roughs, either thoughtlessly or with mischievous
intent, several persons were carried over tho
tdf? of the steps. They fell on thc landing
and at the foot of the stairs,
ethers stumbled on them, and BON
than forty persons were trampled under
foot by the punic-stricken multiuide. It
was a long time before they could
be extricated. They were then placed
in improvised ambulances ami taken
to Chambers Street, New-York and St. Vin?
cent's Hospitals, where many heartrend?
ing scenes occurred. Great excite?
ment prevailed in the city and Brooklyn,
aud exaggerated stories of the' calamity were
apread. Tkiiuxe reporters last night
vi-itcd prominent Bridge Trustees
New-York and Brooklyn and other offi?
cials, and obtained their opinions ns
to the cause of the accident and the
means that must be taken to prevent similar
occurrences in the future. The accident is
attributed largely to the iuelliciency of tiie po?
lice system and the police force of the Bridge.
HOW THK ACCIDENT OCCURRED.
Vntil the shadow of a croat calamity settled npon
it yesterday the great Bridge was the most
popular thoroughfare in the city. Tho
few sprinkling showers of rain whit li
fall about noon dui not seem to chook thc ardor of
the thousands who had resolved to devote the- holi?
day to sight-seeing from its height-*, and the cheer?
ful sunshine thut followed Lilied out many nora
who till then had remained housed and snit them
on a siir.ib:ir*erraiid. Until the latter part of tha
afternoon, when overcrowding caused diseoinfoit,
there was no moro delightful place Imaginable than
tho breezy pathway from city to etty, and
none that commanded so magnificent a panorama,
.onie of the brilliant features of oiacuiiig dav
mott repeated,. for th? houser- In tho
Tiiinity hail not yet dolled their
gay decorations, aad the Hags on the shipping at
the wharves fringed tho two eltiei with color. At
inti rvaK daring Hie day processions with bands of
Maia crossed tba Bridge, walking in tho wairo
n av and thus allonling a better view of the soldiery
?ral uniformed civilians than could be obtained any
Ta'liel rise.
'lt: ie was a fatal fascination in all this. It at?
tracted tliousatid-i ami kept them upon tM Bridie,
Tuc Superintendent knew that tba crowd of visitors
to the structure would strain its aeeomaiodotiooa
much more aerioaaly than they had ever baan
?trained before, a.ul lu* mads what Mero suppo-oil
to he aionle preparations for the atm*-. He buiit
additional toU-boxea at eaeh aad and gave
oideis that in eas- ol OYeierowdiOl the title
af travel should bc turned into
the wagoa-ways. as it was on Sunday. Tiie poUoa
foree was nut im r..ised, it h"iu^ supposed tbal
tweuty-four men would be aide to direct the
human stream into proper channels at the
termini, anti prevent loitering in the
mots whoie the temptations would bo
?trongest. lt, was knowu te ba extremely likely
that between 10,000 aad 'jo,ooo petaoaa would li?
on tin- Bridge at unee. imt it was not anticipated
that lim conduct of a small trac'ion of the Bamber
would bring death to a dozen (.mines and su'iern g
te many more.
Th" natural eft. ct of the great crowd of visitors
Md the attractiveness- ol tho Bridge waa steadily
to ri, iv,ise tin- numil,-r upon it. New-York has
always contributed tinny more foo', paaaangera
than Brooklyn, and when tho retwaing
tale met the stream of fresh uriliaN
lin,:; New-York as tho afternoon began 'o draw to a
close, the leetway gradual ly grew aaora and more
ermine 1 and the crowd moy d more and more
Uggishlv. The iemili was inevitable. With only
cue footway tho Bri I ge is a saunteuug pine:*?a
promenade, on wi,icu ont can spend all day
going lack and forth. Still it WM aol thought
mee.gary to th'.ow tho wagon ways open te
P'destrians. As 0:1 Jinn.lay, the s:t*h*-.o"rs be?
came blockaded mitlway batwaso the New-York
entrance ami tho north th towoi. Then
th" maota! of a aaetton al railing
ead thoopaadag thereby of aa outlet late tbe aide
?eada .ottered tba pia?m Fe terdajr, before thia
was done, there came the panie which raoalted in
-rOrriblaaafMacaad death.
The scene of the diead.nl oecarreaea u just al oyo
the anchorage, a little more than half-way between
ti (few-York aatranee ami thc Bret tower. 1 'p to
ah-l place the ro ..dways are all on a level, but lu Itt

taaeaaa.ageeblee.Tht! wagoo aad traaawaTaeoaUnue

lilted neatly lo feet by a broken Hight of fourteen
?tapa The path, which is 10 feel and 7 inches
a.'!-.'. is narrowed ?tightly, bal bardy enough to be
Ptn -ptihie to a trowd. ihe aaeeot ia divided 111
thc middle by a landing about. G feet wide.
Tho steps aro nf wood and rather marrow. A sturdy
?tull of m aai ie exteada hon the station te tba Brat
truss on Mah tide of the walk, ana giv-i- linn foot
?h-r-' to an irou lenee that meets the truss
at the foot of the ht airs. Beyond tho
auib is the roadway, twelve feet oi.ht inches wide,
aeataialae the railway tracks, which are laid on
alceiton- and ties in Ihe ordinary aarface foahioe and
ballasted with rubble. In this part of tba
Bringo there wor. vorfcing yesterday a
few riveters'. riggen, machinists and
laborers, A few Illidge pohcemeu
Wen iu the wagonw: is near bf, WaOtt thara aaa
abo a steady stream ol havel.
About 4 o'clock tho crowd pre.t m dense that a
blockale was formed ou the Bridge extend
feg from the load of tho (tatra
hack several rods to the tower. The number
Ol persona who were faced toward New-York was
eoflkit'iuiy large to All the entire width 0f tho walk
and tue comparatirely small stream going from
this cit* hail for a long time been forcing
lteelf through tbe serried ranks that
met lt at the head of the sta! ra.
The oauiw ot the blacliado seems to have
been eulelly the slow movement of the crowd down
tbe stops. There were man** worooa and children
Who made the descent slowly and with great care foi
there ia a suggestion ot .auger lu th* narrow ness ol
the et*pe aud the ?uw--.Iw-im of the wood. With
the teen lona tudu*, from Brooklyn and th.
rapid movement along the uninter?
rupted and descending pathway from
the tower, nearly 1,000 feet sway,
the slightetit Interruption to tbe regular flow was
bound to cause a difficulty that would grow greater
with every movement. This is exactly
what happened. beginning with a little
crowding tbat at first caused only
merriment and some Kood-huinored Jostling lt
grew until women began to faint, men to shout and
children to cry with terror. The danger of going
over thc steps in the midst of such a crush dawned
udoii those near tho flight and they began frantically
to push back and shout to the advancing
thousands: "Stand back!" Give us room!"
and other vain expostulation*.
It waa like trying to atop the tide, for back
of thc struggling bund reds thousands were throw?
ing their weight against tho ever-increas
inu column. Then roenbectino desperate. Tbey
foturht and straggled and added to tho terror of the
women and children. A policeman jumped upon
the chord of tbo truss and. waving his club,
screamed and gesticulated like a madman. Thu
crowd would not understand hun and
could not obey. Stalwart men wearing the
uniform of thc Grand Army of thc* Kcpuhlio
followed the example of tho policeman. Shunts
went up that people wore being killed, and under
tbo trsnsformiBg intluencool terror the report soon
spread lo those furl Uer back Unit something was
the mutter with the Bridge. In the midst
of the excitement the crowd advancing
from Raw-York fell back a short distance and left
an empty sp;.to at the foot nf tho stairs. At tho
same tune a gang of thoughtless rntban**. to whom
tl.'e'cru.sli v. as either uhr sport ot an opportunity
to ply the vocation of pocket-pit -k in ir,
ansivcreil^a command ol "Lat's give 'em the
grand shove," willi a concerted nub toward tho
st.tv. Au old woman who wss at the head nf thc
steps stumbled and fell forward; a younger
woman followed, and tho human avalanche
went OB th-ir ptostrate forms. Boon others
tripped and f"ll and within a few minutes there
were piles i-f crushed ainl I.L edlBg pieces "f human?
ity at thc foot "f each Hight of stairs and the pniiu
sttiti.'ii erowd was trampling them to
death. The scone nov-* beeime dread?

were landed ia a' [plaoe of safetv. Hats,
umbrellas and canes wen- thrown away IB order

A pcdler's pack was torn lr.un his back and ita

torn from mon's backs and slyirta
and sleeves trers ripped out of woman's dresses.
Stoles of willina hands wore lout tu tin- rcs.'ie of

of communicating with Hie gait un n at cither

<text>BROOKLYN BRIDGE.
Formal Opening to th Public of the
Great Structure Connecting: the Cities of
jfew York and Brooklyn The Two Cltiea
jn Gala Attire A Grand Pyrotechnic
Display.
New York, May 25.
Although the day opened cloudy and
jbreatening, the streets approaching the
great suspension bridge" across East River,
both in New York and Brooklyn, were
Uironged with people, and the grand ceremonies
of the formal opening of the
to the public began according to the published
programme. President Arthur and his
Cabinet officers, Governor Cleveland and
other distinguished guests, had special
escorts of police and military. Brooklyn
ivas one mass of decoration and animation.
Throughout the city there appeared to be a
general surrender of business to sight-seeing
and celebrating. The main business avenues,
the heights, and many streets clear out into
Ihe suburbs, were decked most gayly with
flags and bunting and flowers for the bridal
with the city over the river. Public buildings,
private houses, and the street cars and
trucks fly the colors of all nations in honor
of the opening of the big bridge."
The following cut, which is a correct
view of the massive structure, we are enabled
to present to our readers through the
courtesy of the Chicago Tribune:
Throughout the length of Columbia
Heights, and the streets opening into that
fashionable neighborhood, the decoration
was very general, and the effect handsome.
The houses of Colonel Boebling, Chief Engineer
of the bridge, and of Mayor Low, of
Brooklyn, were decked with flowers and
bunting, and the coats-of-arms of New
York and Brooklyn.
From the towers of the great bridge the
National flag waved, and the span-across
the river was dotted with flags from one end
to the other.
The Seventh Regiment, N. G., State of
New York, Colonel Emmons Clark commanding,
detailed as the military escort for
the occasion, assembled at the armory in
full uniform. A guard of twenty were detailed
to march on either side the President's
carriage. The command marched
down Park and Eifth avenues to the Fifth
Avenue Hotel, the President's quarters,
where it was drawn up.
The sidewalks along the route were lined
with people. On Madison Square it was estimated
that 10,000 people were gathered.
The President and invited guests occupied
carriages, which were drawn up in
line on the south side of the hotel. In the
first carriage sat President Arthur and
Mayor Edson. In the other carriages were
Secretaries Frelinghuysen and Folger,
Postmaster-General Gresham, Secretary
Chandler, Attorney General
Brewster, Marshal McMichael, of the District
of Columbia; Allen Arthur, T. J.
Phillips, Surrogate Rollins, Governor Cleveland,
Governor Ludlow, of New Jersey;
Governor Fairbanks, of "Vermont; Generals
Stryker and Slocum; Governor Littlefield,
of Rhode Island, and staff; General Carr
and staff, Collector Bobertson, Congressman
Cox, Hon. William "Windom. and Speaker
Keiferr State Senators and the Peruvian
Minister.
The committee representing the Brooklyn
Bridge Trustees escorted the President and
Cabinet to their carriages, other guests falling
into line and taking the carriages assigned
them. When the cairiages passed
the Seventh Regiment the command presented
arms. The military then broke into
column and maivhed down Fifth avenue
and Broadway to the City Hall Park, where
the members of the Common Council received
the President and Cabinet.
When the City 'Hall was reached the column
halted, and those in the carriages took
their places in the line on foot The inarch
over the bridge was a pretty sight as viewed
from the roof of a neighboring building.
The long line of soldiers in white and gold,
with their guns flashing in the sunlight and
the surging crowd of citizens, seemed to approach
the New York tower very slowly.
Contrasted with the size of the bridge, the
multitudes upon it appeared almost
From below the procession which
moved over the footway could scarcely be
seen at all.
In Brooklyn the parade was equally successful.
In the column which started from
the City Hall were the Twenty-third
National Guard, Mayor Low and the
officials of the city Government; also the
Society of Old Brooklynites; Major-General
Hancock, commanding the military division
of the Atlantic, and his staff; Commodore
Upshur, commanding the naval station of
the port of New York, :md his staff; officers
of the United States army and
navy; the Brigadier-Generals of the Second
Division, and their staffs; and
prominent guests who had received
invitations to attend the opening ceremonies.
All were under the command of General
James Jourdan, the Grand Marshal of the
day. The column marched through Bemsen
and Clinton streets, and over the bridge to
the New York lower, where the President
was received and escorted to the Brooklyn
station, where the iormal opening
monies took place.
When the two columns met on the bridge
National salutes were fired from Forts
Columbus and Greene and the men-of-war.
The chimes of Trinity and the bells of St
Paul and many other churches pealed out,
and the steam vessels in the harbor blew
their whistles.
A temporary flooring had been laid over
that portion of the structure which will
serve as a roadway for' arriving and departing
trains. To this part of the building the
bulk of the spectators were consigned, the
chairs on the north being reserved for Brooklyn,
and those on the opposite for the gentlemen
crossing ihe bridge with the chief
dignitaries of the day.
It was half an hour after the time figuring
on the programme when the real business
of the hour began. Mr. J. S. T.
presided over the exercises, which
were opened with music by the Twenty-third
Regiment Band, and prayer by Bishop
Lutlejohn. Then followed President W. C.
Kingsley's presentation address, and the acceptance
addresses by the Mayors of Brooklyn
and New York. Levy played a cornet
solo, and Abram S. Hewitt came after him
with a long oration, of a historical character.
Bev. Dr. Storrs mad an eloquent
oration, and then the exercises came to a
close. The two cities had been duly and
formally wedded, and the icrial highway
declared open to travel.
In the evening the entire population of
S i
r
New York and Brooklyn appeared to be 1
rushing madly toward the bridge or toward
points trom which it could be seen.
The burning of fireworks began at eight
o'clock and continued for an hour, during
which time the heavens seemed ablaze with
bursting rockets and shells. Upon each
tower and from the middle of the bridge a
perfect stream of colored meteors kept shooting
up into the sky, to the amazement and
delight of the tens of thousands of spectators
on house-tops, docks and boats. Brooklyn
was brilliantly illuminated, and the heights,
viewed from the New York side, seemed
aflame with light.
At nine o'clock the last rocket shot
heavenward, and, with a tremendous parting
salute from the steam whistles of the
excursion boats, the crowds turned homeward.
As far as they were concerned the
celebration was over.
At the Brooklyn Academy of Music last
night there was another crush at the reception
given to the President and other guests
of Brooklyn's Mayor. There was no handshaking,
the guests merely bowing their acknowledgments
to the salutations. A number
of minor accidents occurred during
the day, but not of a serious character.
THE WORK.
A TRIUMPH OF ENGINEERING SKTLI..
The great bridge is largely the product of
the severe winter of 1866-7. During that winter
the East River ferry-boats came to grief.
"Brooklyn business-men embarking on a Fulton
ferry-boat found themselves, after an hour's
cruising, in the vicinity of Hellgate. For days
the rlve"r was so choked with ice" as to be almost
impassable. Some boats, in beating against
ice-cakes in'a strong current, were driven down
around Governor's Island and then to Staten
Island. The inconvenience was great, but
the losses sustained by certain business
interests were such that a vigorous demand
was made for a bridge. Soon after men
of capital obtained a charter, and a bridge
company was formed with a capital of $5,000,-000.
The charter was afterward amended so
that the enterprise should be managed exclusively
by the authorities of the two cities,
Brooklyn agreeing to pay two-thirds of the
entire cost William CL Kingsley, of Brooklyn,
deserves to be called the lather of the great
bridge. As early as 1805 he employed an engineer
to draw plans and make estimates
for a suspension-bridge, and when the time
came for action he became the acknowledged
leader of the enterprise. May 23, 1867, John A.
Boebling was appointed Engineer. In September
of the same year he made his report of surveys,
plans and estimates. Work was
on the site of the foundation of the
Brooklyn tower January 3, 1870. Engineer
Boebling. however, did not live to see this
work begun. In the summer of 1809, while at
work on the location of the Brooklyn tower,
an incoming ferry-boat collided with some
timbers which crushed his foot, and he died of
lock-jaw about two weeks later. His son,
Washington A. Boebling, was called upon to
take up and complete his father's great work.
He was equal to the emergencj Although
falling a victim to the "caisson disease" in
December, 1871, he supervised the work from
his sick room. He has never recovered his
health and never will.
The construction of this gigantic cobweb for
travel has furnished an episode of engineering
the magnitude of which few appreciate.
The towers are 27G& feet in height. The
cables are anchored inland at a distance of 930
feet back from the towers on each side. The
anchorages are triumphs of stone-masonry,
119 by 133 feet at the base and rising to an elevation
of 90 feet above high-water mark.
Weighing about 60,000 tons each, they are of
course capable of resisting an enormous strain
from the cables. A stranger viewing the towers
for the first time naturally asks: "How was
it possible to obtain a proper foundation for
such structures so near the water?"
The query is easily answered. The submarine
section of the tower was constructed
above water in the open air and then
sunk to its bed deep down in the sand or
where the fishes were wont to disport This
was accomplished by the diving-bell and the
air The style of diving-bell used
is called a caisson. It resembles nothing so
much as an inverted chest. It must be lined
with boiler-iron, seamed air-tight, with means
of ingress and egress for msn and materials.
By the use of this caisson many formidable
difficulties have been surmounted and a perfect
foundation laid where the waves will
wash their mighty bases for ages. The foundation
is laid eighty feet below the surface of
the river and the granite masonry is true to a
hair's breadth. The cables sweep gracefully
over the top of the towers 276 feet in
height. The bridge floor, which the cables
sustain, is an immense steel framework consisting
of two systems of girders at right
angles to each other. The main girders, supporting
the floor proper, are graceful trusses
thirty-three inches deep, placed seven
feet six inches apart. To these are
attached four steel rope suspenders
from the cables. Parallel and longitudinal
trusses, Avith braces or stays, give the
combination strength in every direction. At
the towers the framework is firmly anchored.
The weight of the central span of the entire
suspended structure is 6,740 tons. It is estimated
that at no tim6 will this weight be increased
by cars, vehicles and passengers more
than 1,380 tons, giving a total maximum weight
of 8,120 tons. Of this enormous weight, 6,290
tons are sustained by the cables and 1,190 tons
by the suspensory stays of steel wire ropes diverging
from the tops of the towers to points
about fifteen feet apart along the bottom of
four of the vertical trusses. These stays extend
out from the towere 400 feet They form
important auxiliaries to the cables. The central
avenue of the bridge is to be used as a
footway. Its width is nineteen feet, and it is
elevated above the avenues on the sides some
ten feet. The side avenues are occupied by
cars moving from end to end by means of an
endless wire rope operated by a stationary engine.
The cables suspended from the great towers
are fifteen .and three-quarter inches thick. In
each cable there are 5,000 wires, the whole
mass being subdivided into skeins or strands
fashioned like skems of yarn or thread. Each
cable contains nineteen of these strands of 278
wires each, and each skein is a continuous
wire nearly 1,000,000 feet in length. The
first man to cross from tower to tower was E.
F. Farrington, the Master Mechanic of the enterprise,
who made the trip August 25, 1876.
Then the detail of the work went on, each day
adding to the number of wires from tower to
tower, until finally a light foot-bridge was run
across, and all who desired could walk from
one anchorage to the other over the tops of
the towers and across the river. Then the
cradles, ten in number, were got in position,
so that the men engaged in the cable-making
could regulate the wires, a matter of no small
difficulty, since the atmospheric eliects of the
sun and wind were such that frequently the
cables varied as much as half a foot in height
in the course of a das'. The deflections were,
however, all overcome, and the last wire Avas
run across October 15. 187S.

<text>PROBING BRIDGE BREAK
LM BARBIER AXD SEXTOX
BEG IX IXQUIRY
MR. HENNING SAYS STRUCTURE IS A.
MENACE, AND BLAMES NIGGARDLY
POLICY OF OFFICIALS—TRAF
FIC PARTLY SUSPENDED.
Inquiries regarding the safety of the Brooklyn^
Bridge and the suspected negligence of the
bridge officials were started yesterday by the
District Attorney's office, the Police Department
and the Health Board. If it ascertained that de
fects In the bridge structure were known by the
bridge officials in time to prevent the breaks) en
Wednesday, the grand jury will be asked to
make an investigation.
Gustavus C. Henning. a consulting engineer.
who supervised the construction of the section
of the bridge on which the breaks occurred, de
clared yesterday that the bridge should be built
anew. He said that officials were warned at
the time the bridge was built that the materials
were faulty, but their use was Insisted on to
save cost.
Controller Coler argued that if tunnels had
been constructed between Brooklyn and Man
hattan for the trolley lines there would have
been no reason for overloading the bridge. The
structure, it Is declared, never was intended for
trolley traffic.
It was ascertained yesterday that the iron
work of the bridge had not been repainted in
three years, and much of it was rusty. Runt
appeared to be a cause for the breaks in the
bridge structure.
No regular systems of Inspections has been
in use on the bridge under the present adminis-
tration. The engineers can learn of injuries to
the structure only by accidental reports.
Traffic on the north side of the bridge was sus
pended yesterday, but a few trains and trolley
cars were run. shuttle fashion, on the south
side all day and all night. Many thousands of
persons walked over the bridge.
The ferries between Manhattan anJ Brooklyn
¦were crowded at the rush hours. The division of
travel from the bridge to the ferries did not
much affect the railroads in Brooklyn
Workmen removed broken parts' of th«» bridge
yesterday, and it was said that new parts would
be substituted within forty-eight hours. The en
gineers of the bridge declare that when traffic
is resumed the bridge will be as strong as it
ever was.
V.VU.U IT WT.W BE S ITS,
GUSTAVU3 C. HENNING THINKS THE
BRIDGE IS NOW A MENACE TO
PUBLIC SAFETY.
"The Brooklyn rtrlde** I* mtnsc* to *h»
safety of th* people who crow It.**
So said Gustavus C. Henning. a consulting en
gineer, who had charge of the part of the
bridge construction that has now proved de
fective.
Mr. Hennlns was on the North Drive, vratch
ing the repair work that was being done.
"The work is faulty,'* he continued, "because
of the niggardly policy of "the; city Oifu-lais who
had charge of the construction of the bridge.
They insisted on the cheapest kind of work, al
though they were told that such a policy would,
result in the precise trouble that has now
arisen. What was wanted was a bridge that
would accommodate its. If to the increase of
traffic that would come with the growth of th*
two cities— as they were then. No thought was
taken of the morrow, however, and no idea of
anything more than was necessary at that time
was entertained.
"What is the result? We have a bridge that
is not strong enough to stand the demands
that are made upon it. It is of no permanent
use. this tinkering and repairing. The only
remedy Is to build the bridge over again. To
the lay mind this suggestion may appear ab
surd. Engineers, however, remember that the
bridge between Cincinnati and Covington was
built anew and without the suspension of,
traffic for even a single day. That bridge is*
now one of the most substantial structures of
Its kind in the world.
"Who can say that these defects that have
been discovered are the only ones in the bruise?
If there are no more the bridge will be safe
for traffic when these have been repaired.
Only the most thorough examination; however, j
can prove that all the suspenders are intact.
I No doubt this inspection will be made imme-
diately.
"Probably the best thins: that can be done 13
to bolster the weak point from underneath.
Of course this would be only temporary, and
would cost considerable. But It would be
the quickest method of dealing with the diffi
cult v If the bridge authorities wait for the
material necessary for permanent repairs they
will delay matters for a long time, because It
will all have to be made especially for the work.
i There are four main cables, and each is Balls
i to the same breakage. What would cause a
1 breakage? Well, what would break a straw?
Can you Imagine anything breaking without
having too much weight placed on it? I can
not, v V-'
"The trouble lies in the fact that the suspend
ers are of the poorest material. I ought to
know because I not only designed it and super
intended the construction of it. but also super
intended the construction of the material. WWhetn t
I advised the use of better material the author
ities said that the cities could not afford It.
"There are two things about the bridge that
are all right. These are the towers. They will
I stand for an indefinite length of time, and I do
not believe enough weight can be put on them
to affect them in the least. As for the remain
der of the bridge— well, unless it is reconstruct
ed with a much greater foundation of strength,
or unless the traffic it is now called on to sus
tain be decreased enormously, some day there 1
will be a terrible catastrophe."
DEFECTIVE WIRE WAS USED
MATTER OF NOTORIETY WHEN THIN
BRIDGE WAS BUILDING THAT MA
TERIAL below STANDARD .f
WAS ACCEPTED. r
There are many who remember that wtrv
which was tested and found defective was used
In the construction of the bridge. It was a mat
ter of notoriety at the time that some of th»
wire that had been submitted for use was found
of a grade lower than the standard and was re
jected by the examining engineers, but was of
fered ag&in and accepted. It was admitted be
fore the bridge was finished that some of this
wire was used. Where it Is no man can tell now,
and It may be that the break that is causing so
much' trouble and subjecting the people of both
sides of the river to such inconvenience may be j
some of this wire that was smuggled in by the
use of influence or money.

<text>By Arnold Prince
A FEW days ago a youthful
Westerner well, he isn't
exactly youthful, but in
pome mysterious fashion he
manages not to grow up?burst into
the office and gasped
"They're taking Brooklyn Bridge
apart!" He sat in a chair to col?
lect himself. "Brooklyn Bridge!" he
emphasized. After forty five
years!"
In spite of the fact that he was
addressing a group of Manhattanese
who had grown somewhat callous to
Brooklyn Bridge, condescendingly
looking upon it as something too
closely identified with the borough
of alarm clocks and rubber plants,
he caused something of a sensation.
"Actually?" inquired the stout
member of the office, who thinks
kindly of the Westerner and
therefore takes him seriously some?
times. "Taking the bridge apart?"
Enthusiasm Wouldn't Down
"Well, not exactly taking it
apart," admitted the Westerner, a
tiny wave of depression resulting
from the concession to conservatism,
"but they're taking out some of the
bolls." IIis enthusiasm surged back
at the thought of the bolts. "Been
there forty years," he exclaimeJ.
jubilantly. "Think"?in an awed
voice?"how many persons have
passed over the old bridge in that
time!"
One who is a native of the big
city and does not know in what ven?
eration Brooklyn Bridge is held by
all outsiders?aii^l, truth to tell, by
most natives?might find difficulty
in appreciating the Westerner's agi?
tation. But in any case, at least
two of his statements require clear?
ing up.
In the first place, it is not forty
five years since the bridge was fin?
ished, but only thirty-seven. The
span ?vas turned over to the public
on May 24, 1883, and so the four
decades will not be up until May
24, 1023. A tablet states, however,
that it was dedicated in October,
1875.
Paint to Cost $85.000
Nor, as intimated, is it true that
the bridge is being taken apart. It
is a fact that extensive alterations
and repairs are being made, among
the first, improvements decided upon
being a reinforced floor along the
entire length of the span and a new
coat of paint. The painting alone
will cost $85,000.
Hew and there, too, sections of
the steel work are being strength?
ened, and the old bolts?they are
actually pins?arc being replaced by
new one?.
The Westerner was greatly
wrought up when he discovered the
metal pieces being plucked from the
venerable structure- sort of sever?
ing the threads, you know, from
among the old?hut let no one jump
lo the conclusion that his is an
isolated case.
A walk across the span any day
when the workers are at their tasks
will show this is not the fact,
Many stop to watch the riveters
at work. In New York City rubber?
necking is one of the recognized and
established diversions, but there is
something different about these
?.razor**. They see in these overalled
figures not mere mechanics engaged
in unscrewing nuts, repainting iron
work and replacing boards, but
votaries of a holy task performing
sacred rites on an edifice, grown
hallowed through the generations.
"I Was There"
The other day a graybeard paused
in his walk and beckoned to one of
the workers. The worker was in a
group of others on a cord at the far
side of the elevated rails, and it
meant considerable trouble for him
to cross over the narrow footpath
to the middle roadway for pedes,
trians, but he did it. Thus do th<
mellowing influences of sentimenl
and tradition exert themselves!
"See you are making repair-,'
orTered the graybeard.
"Representing some iron com
pany?" inquired the workingman
eying the other suspiciously.
"a\"o. Live in Brooklyn. I wa
there when they opened this bridge
"Yeh?"
"Yes. Abo Hewitt made the
speech. Fine speech. The Presi
dent of the United States w 13 then
and so was the Governor ind th<
Mayor of w York Brooklyi
didn't belong to New Vori; then,
you know and a lot o^ people."
"Must have been a great sight."
"Yes. You born in Brooklyn'."'
"No." The workingman showed
a trace of uneasiness. "Kansas. But
1
it's a great old bridge," he hastened
to assert.
"Yes?"
"Yes. Phsaw, none of them other
bridges can compare with it even
yet."
"Can it be possible?"
The Same Steel Pieces
"Sure See them big steel cross
pieces underneath? Them things
that support the rails, you know?
Well, them has been there ever
since the bridge was put up and
they're as good as ever. No, I'm not
kiddin'. You take them same pieces
on the Manhattan Bridge, now, and
they're three or four times as heavy
and not a bit better."
"Really?"
"Sure. Say. I been workin' on
bridges all my life and 'f I don't
know a bridge no one does. It's a
great old bridge, I'll tell the world."
"I'm glad to hear you say ro,"
said the gruybeard. He shook hands
solemnly with the mechanic. "Too
bad you weren't born in Brooklyn,"
he called back as he moved away.
"Another of thorn Brooklyn Bridge
nuts," remarked the ironworker as
he started back for his aerie. "But
she's a good old bridge at that."
She is. Grover Whalen, win
ought to know, seeing he is the Coni
missiner of Plant, and Structures
and therefore responsible for i lie
condition of the structure, insist?
most enthusiastically that she is
swearing that just as soon as thai
new floor is down, and a few of the
bolts?pins?are tightened up or re?
placed, she'll be as good as new.
?No Danger of Falling
From time to time disturbing
rumors have been heard that th<
ancient link was about to fall down
or was sagging dangerously in spots
but each time the experts wen
called upon to make an examinatioi
they found, as much to their owi
astonishment as that of any one else
that the figure of speech was liter
ally true.
Brooklyn Bridge not only is per
forming all the service original 1;
set out for it, but is easily and safel;
carrying a trafile several time
greater than dreamed of by its wi',1
est protagonist.
And assuredly it isn't losing it
hold on the affections of the pcopl
in the provinces.
The other day?it was the hou
when the 9 a. m. office employee
verc jamming Nassau Street in thei
rush to get to their places of en
loyment on time;?rushingthousami
in the downtown district were halte
by a couple of dusky honeymooner
who were too absorbed in their hap
piness to notice the ravages the
were indicting upon the traffii
They were darkies of pronounce
Southern type and apparently i
fairly,prosperous circumstances, ft
each was adorned by the habiliment
which to those cf their kind bespea
the height of fa.shion, good taste an
brilliant color.
The bridegroom, who was hup
??nd fairly beaming with newly wo
marital happiness had on a sky-bh
suit with slanting pockets vivid
?set off by glistening tan shoes ar
a blazing red necktie.
Clear From Alabama
The bride glanced up at him fro
time to time, love and adoratio'1 i
her eyes.
"Yessah," admitted the giant 1
a pedestrian whose heart was s?nre
by so much happiness and ?ngag?
him in conversation. "All the W?
fum ol' Alabam."
"Out a little early for sightseein
aren't you?" pressed the pedestria
"Yessah, boss," granted tin' gn.r
"Yessah, but nie 'nd mab wif? -th
yeh is man wife?is aimin' t<> spei
the day on Brooklyn Bridge. K
you all please direct me 'nd mi
wife as to the wheahabouts ?>f tl:
yeh Brooklyn Bridge'.'"
The pedestrian could and did, i
though it meant making him a f?
minutes late at the office.
A great bridge with a grant h
tory. There may be some who c?->>
to the city and fail to visit. Con?
Island. Sonic may even neglect
climb the dimly lit stairs to t
crown of the ?Statue of Liberty, -i
doubtless few fail to attend a p<
formanoe at the Hippodrome.
But who is there who conns fr?
afar and neglects to make at
one pilgrimage to Brooklyn Bridf.
?Seen on a misty day, what fail
_
sight is there than its towers of
masonry risiag above the surround?
ing vapors? And what more Deauti
ful than Manhattan seen from the
center of the span, when darkness
steals on and the myriads >f elec?
tric lights conven the huge down?
town structures into frail edifices of
incandescents and magic?
It? Utilitarian Side
And yet, as brief it shall be
very brief, for statistics, somehow
don belong in this picture?survey
of the figures will show, the bridge
also has a pretty fan- utilitarian
record.
In UM s the R. R. T. furnished

there had been 800,000 trips be?

count of ira Hie on all the city
bridges between October 15 and
November 15, when travel 's con
idered normal, the ligures for L920

sea, and to the north an edge of the
New York navy yard and the other
g^eat spans gird'ng the river. Some?
times an artist will be seen making
sketches, and on warm summer eve
j ings the benches are never quite
free of the silhouetted forms of
sweethearts watching the craft slip?
ping along the waters.
Thirteen Years in Building
For the benefit of those stati
tically inclined it may be added that
the bridge took more than thirteen
years to build, that it cost more than
$::,">,000,000, and that until more
modern achievements came along it
was generally looked upon?ir
Brooklyn, certainly, if nowhere else
?as the eighth wonder of the wor'.d
Looking back <>ver the newspapers
cf the day when the bridge was
opened to traffic one may get a vivic
impression how the span was looker;
upon at that time, and abo as to.th?
source of that sentiment and affec?
tion which all but converted th<
structure into a national monument
Jl must be remembered that when
1 this marvel of engineering came inte
I being there were only 50,000.00(
persons in the United States, bul
5,000,000 in the entire State of New
.York and only 2.000,000 in New
York and Brooklyn combined.
Nothing so imposing and wonder
ful had been seen in the Unite*
States and at but few places in th<
world.
President Arthur himself jour
neyed from Washington to Brooklyn
ro attend the ceremonies, and it wai
.an impressive spectacle indeed whet
j he and Governor Cleveland, escorte?
by the 7th Regiment, walked acrosi
the structure.
Looking back over the newspaper?
one may observe scores of adver
I tisements inviting* "ladies and stran
gers making the delightful tri]
across the East River" to seek res
and relaxation after the unprece
dented experience in the refresh
ment parlors open on that occasion
Cities Made Holiday
New York and Brooklyn both de
i clared a holiday; all the exchange
were closed, as were the courts an
public offices; buildings were decc
rated with flags and bunting, an
there were several imposing recer
tions, the most impressive bein
that at the home of Colonel Wast
ington A. Roebling, the chief er
gineer, in Brooklyn, which was at
tended by the President.
Virtually the only public institv,
tion open for business on that grea
and glorious day was Castle Garde*
which, of course, had to take car
j of the daily ingress of immigrant:
never dreaming that as time went o
it would be converted into an aqiu
rium and a headquarters for strany
fish.
In Brooklyn Mayor Setli Low in?
troduced an innovation in the shape
of row? of gas jets along the roof of
his house on Columbia Heights, and
Mayor Edson of New York was also
doing everything possible^ to make
the day a success. True, there were
some in Manhattan who looked with
disfavor '?pon the bridge, although
scoffing at the suggestion that any
number ?f person? would be in?
duced thereby to move to Brooklyn,
but these critics were in the minor?
ity. There was an effort to stir up
a scandal over the fact that the
celebration was so arranged as to
take place on Queen Victoria's birth?
day, but the agitation died away
when it was explained that the date
selected was not the result of a pro
British plot.

<text>BROOKLYN BRIDGE’S SAFETY.
Margin Is Sc Narrow That Repairs Are
Urgently Needed.
NEW YORK, BSept. 16.—District At
torney Philbin today recelved the report
of the two engineers appointed by him
to examine into the condition of the
Brooklyn bridge, following an accident of
July 24, when some of the suspenders
broke, and as to its present safety.
Mr. Philbin did not think it advisable
to make public the entire report, but he
quoted the engineers as having reached
the conclusion that the margin of safety
was so small that the necessity for re
pairs was very urgent.
The district attorney will submit the
report to other engineers before-deciding
whether or not to present the case to the
grand jury.</text>

<text>364 CARS AN HOUR
That Number Crossed Brooklyn Bridge
in Sixty Minutes Last Night
Three hundred and sixty-four sur
face cars were run over the Brooklyn
bridge, New York, between 5 and 6
o’clock last evening, this being the
greatest number of cars ever run over
the span in one hour.
Since Captain Bourk, of the bridge
squad, introduced the method of load
ing the women on the cars separate
from the men, the police have been
able to handle the crowds during the
rush hour with little or no difficulty.
Until the time the Bourke system
was adopted the greatest number of
cars to pass over in sixty minutes
was 344 and that was accomplished
only after considerable trouble.
Policeman Harry Smith, of the
bridge squad, said last night that
364 cars an hour would be the regular
schedule every night.—New York Sun.

<text>INSPECTION SYSTEM FAULTY
Breaking of Rod Some Time Ago Was
Caused by the Wind—Neces
sity for Improvement at
Once is Urgent.
New York, October 6.—District Attorney
Philbln today made public the report of
Edwin Duryea and Joseph Mayer, the
Bpeclal engineering experts appointed by
him to look into the condition of the
Brooklyn bridge after the breaking of
several suspender rods and suspender
bands, July 24 last.
These experts were apointed to make
this report with a view to presenting the
matter to the grand Jury If It should be
found that the bridge department has
been negligent. The report of the ex
perts was first submitted to Mr. Philbln,
September 14. It was full of technicalities
such as the general public could not read
ily understand and stories appeared In
public print that the bridge was unsafe,
Mr. Philbln thereupon submitted It to
W. B. Parsons, chief engineer of the
Rapid Transit Commission, who stated
after reading It that the bridge was per
fectly safe.
Inspection is Faulty.
The experts find that the Inspection of
the structure as maintained by the bridge
department Is faulty but that the bridge
is now practically as strong as when
completed. One trouble Is that the mov
ing loads which cross the bridge have
increased so rapidly that the structure
must be strengthened. The accident of
the breaking of the suspender rods and
bands which was discovered July 24,
though some 'of those rods have been
broken previously, Is found to have been
due to the wind pressure, the wind blow
ing against the platform and cars caus
ing a pressure transverse to the bridge,
thus causing the rods to bend.
The experts maintain that the inspec
tion of the bridge should be done by en
gineers and not by mechanics as at pres
ent.
No Evidence of Electrolysis.
Referring to stories which have ap
peared In print that electrolysis has
weakened the bridge, the experts declare
that they found no evidence of this con
dition. They also say there Is no useless
dead load In the form of mall tubes, tele
graph and telephone cables, etc., on the
bridge.
They find that the safety of the bridge
can be increased by remedying certain
defects In the design. They hasten to say,
however, that they do not criticise the
designer, and call attention to the fact
that since thiB structure was designed
great advancement has been made In
such work, and If such a bridge were now
built, the designer would have the benefit
of experience since the Brooklyn bridge
was erected. They say tuat the needed
Improvements could be made with com
paratively moderate cost and also de
clare that the present margin of safety
Is so small that the necessity for repairs
is very urgent.</text>

Milwaukee, Nov. 4. "Charlie
Chaplin" sermons were called "im
possible" by the Rev. Samuel H.
Woodrow of St Louis in speaking be
fore the Woman's Board of Missions
of the Interior, which closed here to
day. "There has been much talk about
making sermons interesting," said
the speaker. "We never can make
sermons as interesting as melo
dramas or prayer meetings as amus
ing as Charlie Chaplin. They never
were meant to be so.
"If a heathen dropped into New

	<text>RIVALRY BETWEEN MOVIE MEN
Charlie Chaplin, highest paid
actor in the world, is appearing
at the Melbourne and Liberty to
day in the same picture, "His
First Vacation.'' Never before
has the same actor appeared in
the same picture at two Tacoma
movies at the same time.
It is an evidence of the keen
rivalry between movie men. The
Melbourne had signed the film
for next week. The Liberty, how
ever, obtained the same picture
for the latter half of this week.
Manager Sumni**rville of the Mel
bourne telegraphed a hurry-up
order for his film yesterday when
he heard of the Libertys' move,
and obtained his copy of tlie film
by express yesterday. He put it
on his bill at 4 p. ni. without an-

the work of a man who gets

I T was n odd match when the news
leaked out that Charlie Chaplin, fun

world, had married Mildred llarris whose
film specialty is tears, "sob stuff." And
the news of the marriage 'was soon follow

the tearful bride.
Nobody seemed to know jti~t what was
the matter but in due time Mrs. Chaplin
admitted that she and her husband had
separated. Then followed several state

came ifom Mr. Chaplin.
At last the 'matrimonial troubles drifted
into the Los Angeles courts. Mrs. (Chap

plea for a divorce. Mr. Chaplin did, not

A.-Well, when we %rere married Mr.
Chaplin told me he wanted me to break

he did not want me iorking with them.
So, when I was in the hbspital, after I was
first taken ill, I sent a written notice that
I would not be with them any more and I
was under age. My lawyer told me we
could break the contract. Then, in Feb
ruary. when I came back from Mt. Lowe.
they had been sendjag me my check each
-:eek, and I had been sending them back
and they would return them again, but I
had not cashed any. In February a friend
of mine, Miss Bweet, asked me to go to
New York with her when I came back
from Mt. Lowe, and Mr. Chaplin had been
away so long, and when he came back he
said it would do me good to go to New
York, so I wentt with her. But he wouldn't
give me but $150.'and when I got East r
bought a lot of baby clothes ad some baby
furniture and a few other things, and I did
not have enough money and I wired for
more money. But he would not send me
any more, so I wired mother to please
ash one of my checks.
Q.--That 'was the check that would re
a-dirm your contract irith the Universal
-eople, which he advised you to break?
A-Yes, sir.
Q.-Did you advise him with reference
to your circumstances?
A-Yes.
Q.-DId you advise him that you expect
ed to purchase some furniture for the ex
pected child?
A-Yes, sir.
Q.-And he declined to send you any
money at all?
A.-Yes.
Q.-And he was making apozimately
16,000 or I7,000 a month at that time?
A.-More than that.
Q.-You mentioned the furniture. You
say there was an arrangement made about
snme turniture for the baby's room?
A.-BDefore I went East Mr. Chaplin said
Icould get a set of furniture for my room
un in our home, because it was very dark.
Q.-That was the room in which you
were to be confined?
A.-Yes, sir; my own roem. So.
hoght it at Beriker Crothers, end when

=urnished in thE aew furniture, ad he
took me up to see it, and I was very happy
about it aid he seemed to be quite pleased.
but when the bfll came he refused to pay

Comedian Strategically Shy on
Most Questions, but Vents
Some Positive Opinions
Doesn't Know What Sort of
Woman He Likes Best and
Would .Rather Read Hamlet
Than Play It.
By Mar giteriteMooersMar shall
Charlie Chaplin, tho playboy of the
movies, Charlie of the funny feet, the
trained mustache, the Incredible head
gear, handles ,a three-minute Inter
view with all the care he does NOT
bestow on oustard pics and cops.
Charlie is ever so polite about it, mit
nevertheless he acts as It he thought
The Evening World's hot weather
test In mental speed were a bomb of
some sort that might go off in his
hands.
When I saw the brown-eyed, debo
nair, soft-voiced little comedian in the
theatre lobby Just after the rehearsal
of the next release of his friend Mary
Pickford and Just before the showing
of the newest picture of his friend
Douglas Fairbanks, he leaned against
the wall for support, wiggled his fin-
gers nervously and took his full three tatlon. although you'd think him quail

Gains on Schedule, but Parries Most
Thrusts.
It was exactly 17 minutes past 1
when I asked:
Q. No. 1 What Is It that makes you
so funny?
Charlie Chaplin (grinning bashfully.
60 that he showed most of his very
hlto and even teeth, and looking orr
into space, somewhere over my left
shoulder) I don't know ask tho kids.
Q. No. 2 Ought movie salaries to
go down?
Charlie Chaplin (straightening his
drooping shoulders, an Indignant In
flection In the soft voice) Certainly
not!
Q. No 3 Is the Rolshevlk Govern
ment going to last In Russia?
Charlie Chaplin I do not know.
Q. No. 4 Why don't you want to
marry again?
Charlie Chaplin (who was recently
quoted as saying that he didn't, but
who seoms to have changed his mind
girls, here's your chance!) Who
says that I don't? Quoting me to that
effect was a ralBtafce. I certainly do
want to marry again very much!
Q. No. 5 What sort of woman do
you like best?
Charlie Chaplin (again grinning em.
barrasscdly and tying his fingers Into
bowknots) Now, that's hard to an
swer; I really couldn't say; I couldn't
even tell whether she's blond or bru
nette; I couldn't answer that.
Q. No. 6 Are you In favor of an
Irish republic?
Charlie Chaplin (determinedly play
ing safe) I prefer to be discreet and
not commltmyself.
The first minute was gone and we
were one answer ahead of the avcrago
called for by the tlmo schedule.
SECOND MINUTE.
Slows Down His Ansuers, but UoUls
to Schedule.
Q. No. 7 Should women smoke
cigarettes?
Charlie Chaplin (hesitating, Hps
moving nervously, then smiling dlplo-
vicw to obtaining an Increase In
fares. Nathan Kushncr, No. 1057
Simpson Street, former Interborough
guard, said that while there was no
official union statement showing that
the company was back of the strike.
It was freely passed from one em
ployee to another that tho company
was going bankrupt and that the
only chance for employees to get a
pay increase was to help tho company
obtain a ten-cont fare which tho
company would share.
Commissioner Hirsuficld said that
the Interborough receivership move
In designed to got an Increased fare.
Tho Transit Commission, ho said,
fears to gTant an Incrcaso for political
reasons. If tho company gots a
"friendly receiver, ns in tho cose of
the D. It. T.," ho predicted, "It will
separate its elevated and subway
systoms, doing away wlln transfers,
and thus getting the equivalent of a
I fare increase,"

Of the Volstead act? You must ex

psychological angle a remarkable hu?

revelation. It explains the appeal of
this poor little feeble creature on the
outglde of the great big world. To the
reade?r unversed in psychology the
outstanding features of the book are
likely to be the triumphant return of
Charlie Chaplin to the land of his birth
his meetings with the great in poli?

unfortunate his intimate confessions
of his likes and dislikes. However, the
real revelation lies in Charlie's visits
to the haunts of his childhood.
Trio whole tone of the book is that
of a half lonely ?'dventurer visiting the
scene:; of his early 1 i fr. reacting with
genuine sympathy to every situation.
We learn of Chaplin's early experi?

of that, experience has been imposed
this magical thing- for his succ?s?? has
been like an Arabian Nights fantasy?
and 1 doubt if he has ever quite real?

This little ragged urchin has stayed
v.ith Chaplin all his life and is the
main reason for his tremendous hu?
man appeal.

OUR or five years ago ?ome neigh?
bor child came rushing to me, all
out of breath. She was all excited, for
she was going to the Hippodrome to see
"Charlie Chaplin himself.''
At thar time "Charlie Chaplin him-'
self didn't mean any more to me than
Charlie in the, movies. But after read?
ing his book T feel that I do know
Charlie Chaplin himself. In another
age. where he would have had to ap
pear directly in person before his
audiences, the chances are that the
personal side of his art would have
been more evident to the people, who
are rather inclined to look down on
the movies, anyhow, and who have re?
garded Charlie Chaplin merely as a
comedian who makes lots of money.
The motion picture ,is a medium of
expression is a syndicate sort of thing.
It takes a tremendous amount of per?
sonality to overcame the?" difficulties.
crowds who have bce'n rooting for
Chaplin have been psychologically cor?
rect. 'While he has an enormous popu?
larity, he doesn't make an appeal to
the crowd mind, but rather a secret
h -?stance to civilization which is in us
nil. and he does it because at heart he
is really the littlo ragged ur?jhin?the

	<text>The Origin of Species.
Of late yeais men of science and oth
ers hive wrangled much over Mr. Dar
win's work on The Origin of Species."
In most of the English and American
reviews his treatise lms been Muverely
criticised, as having an infidel tendency;
not on account of (lie facts therein giv
en, but the conclusion of ihe author.
He appears to liavo been very generally
rnLsunilerstood, judging from a most in
teresting little woik just insued by D.
Appleton Jc Co., this city, beim: the
publictiou of six lectures delivered to
woikiugmen, by Thomas II. Huxley, F.
R. S., Professor of Natural History in
the School of Mines, London. Broadly
slated, the subject of these lectures
consists of an inquiry into the oiii'in of
species and a discussion on the causes
of the phenomena in organic naiure.
The meaning of organic uature is
something that grows, lias life and le
productive powers. It is exemplified
in tliu seed of a plan: in contradistinc
tion to n grain of sand. Organic nature
embraces the vegetable and animal
kingdom, as entirely distinct in tunc
tions from loeke, fluids, and what chem
ists call "elementary matter." Ani
mals and plants are divided by natural
ists into gioups,and these into kitijidoms,
sub-kingdoms,jirovinces, cl.tsses.orders,
families, genera and species- it was
once very generally believed (and many
person entertain such views still) that
there vras'such a thing s spontaneous
generation that is, mere eiemeiitiiry
malter, such as pure water or mineral
dust exposed in favorab'e positions, to
light aud heat, would bring forth vege
tation and nnimalcula spontaneously
Hence it has been asserted that, if there
is such phncomena as the spon.atieous
generation of life, according to the "de
velopment theory" of torao uiituralists
and the -views of Mr. Darwin on the
origin of species, man may have been
developed from the lowest forms of
spontaneous generation. If Mich views
were founded on facts in na'ural history,
pantheism, viz that "God is nature
and naiure is God," would bo suppos
ed upon a very firm foundation.
Mr. Darwin doos not discuss the
question of tpontaneous gonerati -n at
all, and science completely silences
pantheism. Every organism commen
ces existence in an gg-eell or seed, and
each seed is believed to lie been
specially created, with special functions
and powers of reproduction, as stated
in th Scriptures. Al. Pasteur, a dis
tinguished French chemists, has lately
made a great number of carefully con
ducted experiments to lest the theory
of hpomaneous generation. The result
of hi labors rfcem to be conclusive
againt the theoij; no such propert) as
spontaneous crfc&'iou belongs to ele
mentary matter acted upon by thw forces
of nature. An old and bitterly dispu
ted question thus appear now to be
settled scientifically.
Another miestion of much dispute
seems lo bs settled bv Mr. Darwin; tints
the Caucasian, the Malay, and the Ae
gto, according to his facts, are varieties
ol xpecieis and way alMiave descended
fiom a single pair, as set forth in the
Scriptures. On the other Hand, t'ror.
Agassiz and others believe that they
have descended from difieicnt original
pairs, jind thus j.ley would really bo

	<text>Tbe Laat Resatt t Darwinians.
Mr. CoaUi HoDiai Oabwix, the eminent
natural!., and author of The Origin of Species,"
has Just published In England hi laat and groateat
work, Th4 IXttfnt of Jan, which tbe Appletons
hire tn rjrsii, and will issue la a few days, Th
work, we nnderstand, ha created a profound sen
atloa.ln England, where the first edition was sold
la a day, and will undoubtedly, when It appear, be
received here with equal Interest.
Brosdly expressed, Darwinism Is the attempt to
account for the present and past diversities of life
on our globe by means of continuous development,
without the Intervention of special creative flat at
tbe orlglo or each distinct species. It Is well known
tint lo tbe hand of breeder useful peculiarities In
kalmsj aro DerpeloaUl by pairing thoie which
ahow such peculiarities. Our present Improved
breeds of long-horned snd short-horned cattle, rsca
horses, merino sheep, snd the countless varieties of
pigeons, til developed from a alnglo stock the rock
pigeon demonstrate that lhase pecnllirltles may
not only be perpetuated, hut Increased largely, If
not Indefinitely. Thla process Is known a ttttctltm,
and Is used by man exclusively for his own benefit.
Mr. Dsrwln extends this procedure to Nature, with
an Important change tn 11 object. Man car. only
soled vlsibte characteristic! Mature, on .the con
trary, Is contlnuslly scrutlnlxlng the tcAoni being,
and ts continually stamping with approval those
variations which aro useful to tbe orgsnlsm. This
principle works altogether by mean of life aad
death tbe latter being tbe penalty of a failure to
meet successfully the circumstance In which a being
is placed, be those circumstance physical or vital,
enemloaor force in a word, "the condition of
existence."
An lUustratton given by Prof. Haxlsy will serv
to fix this la th mind: "lathe woods of florid
there sro many plgs.tond very curiously, they are
all black. I'rof. Wyman, many year ago, asked
some of the reople why tbey had no white pigs, and
was Informed there wan a root In the wooda (called
pilot root), of which. If the tcAlfs pig eat, their
hoofs cricked and tbey died, while it did not hart
the Uocl pigs at all." This weeding out on the ono
side, and preservation on tbe other, I what Is meant
by natural n'.tctlun.
In the introduction to his new work. The Descent
of Man," Mr. Darwin quotea, with evident sstlsfae
tlon, the remark made by tbe eminent naturalist
Carl Vogt In hla addiess a President of the National
Institution of Geneva, In ISC, that "nobody la Eu
rope at lout now vantured to maintain the doctrlno
of the Independent creation of species" a state
ment rather broader, wo fancy, than the fact will
warrant, though It Is no doubt true that a large
number of naturallsta hare accepted the theory of
Darwinism, snd admit thst species aro tbe modi
fled dcicendants of other species. Mr. Darwin him
self,, however, says that those who accept Ms theory
are mostly tbe younger race, and "of the older and
honored chiefs ln natural science, msny unfortunately
are still opposed to evolution In every form." He men
tions as among the eminent naturallsta who have
ndootud his view Wallace, Itaxley, Lyell, and Lub
bock In England, and In Germany, Duckner, Itolle,
and Hackel. An Italian phlloevpl er, Dr. l'rancesco,
al-omilntalns tbe same views ln n work published
In 1PC9, under Ihe significant ttl'e ot "Man, made In
the Image of God, wo also made In the Image of
Ibe Ape."
The following extracts, from advance sheets of
Mr. Darwin's new book, will snfncteully Indicate Ha

	<text>DARWINISM.
for,the Intelligencer.
ll is tho purposo of tho writer o! litis,
in a lew brief piipera, ttt suitable intervals,
to consider the subject which appears at
the head of this article. It will be bis
eudcavor to avoid unfairness and tediousnesa.
The prominence which tho subject
baa assumed iu the discussions ol the day,
and the important consequences connected
with it, are his incentive to Ibis presentation
of it.
WHAT IS DARWINISM 1
Many ol tho ideas which aro current in
regard to it aro exceedingly crude and
vague. Aud this again has affected the
reception with which it meets nt the
bauds ui' dilleront persons. Some have
hastily embraced it, who, il they had fully
comprehended its ualure would al
least have hesitated before tbey subscribed
themselves amongst its adhereuls.
To some it has been a sort of btle noir,
concerning which lltey have been disposed
to manifest a ioolish alarm. If
they only understood what it is they
would not be afraid to march np to it aud
boldly examine it. Many an object seen

avujuu viumsai.
Darwinism la a form ol what iu modern
scientltlc add theological parlance la called
tvolutiQuism. The following quolallon
trom a living author probably would be
accepted by Ibo parties ranged on either
side ol these questlqps, as substantially a
correct statement of the doctrine in its j
widestI'otm: "Tlioddctrine of Evolution
-known also as the Law Scheme, and the
Development Hypothesis, in its ripest
torm, is that all things wo perceive, including
what are called spiritual phenomena,
have come Itom the simplest beginnings,
solely by means ol Buch forces
and laws as belong lo matter, buppose
all matter expanded into one great cloud
ol atoms. Then these atoms, by virtue of
properties inherent in lltemwlm, would, in
course of time,come together into worlds,
into astronomic systems, into the vegetable
and animal kingdoms, and even into
that great spiritual realm which ia the
chief wonder and glory of Nature."
Tho above is a statement of the doctrine
of evolutionism In general. But as
applied to the different Isolds it has taken
Uireo principal lorms. The general
theory M a stem which separates into
these aa its branohes. The first is the
AVrtiJar Hflolhuit. It deals with the
mftWlnt* nf wnrlrio Afwiwffnar tr?
Ironditfon ol the universe at the moat
remote time in the past to which science
c&u penetrate was thai of matter in a highly
attenuated and widely diffused state.
It is often spoken of a* star-dust or firemlst.
This matter had in it all tho forces
and properties which now belong to it,
and, under their operation elono and in
accordance with them, the sun and
moon and stars wcro evolved, and
took their places in (be order of
the heavens. The sejond lorrn of
evolutionism it Sponiaiuoue Generation.
It deals with the origin tit llle. According
to it, llto, instead of being something
which is Introduced ab alra even at its
tint appearance in the world, is the result
ol the peculiar arrangement ol the atoms
ol water. Huxley, lor example, teaches
that "the matter of lite is composed of
ordinary matter, differing Irom it only in
the mumer.ia which its atoms are aggregated.
The third lorm which evolutionism
assumes is Darmniim, as it is
properly called, or the traiumutaUon of
ycut. It deals with plants and animals.
It undertakes to show that all plants and
animals, Including man, came, by the operation
alone ot oertain natural laws,
from ono or a lew species, which were introduce
by creation, or by spontaneous
generation into the world at? period ?o
remote that we cannot with any distincthob
ho back to it.j
For the Kks ol clearness it has asemed

ol evolutionism and the branches Into
which it divides. Still It ii not true that

ho supposes to belong eiMntially to the
original particles of matter.
TDK NAHK Or DABWIIUSU.
The writer Intends in wj)at he may present
in these articles, to confine himself to
Darwinism proper. It is populate known
by this name because oT the prominence
of Professor Charlca Darwin of England
in connection with it. He first expounded
his theory In an essay published In 1859
on the "Origin of species by Means of Natural
Selection." nis work was soon
translated Into all the leading European
languages. It made a profound popular
ltnpresaiqn, and has been sold by thousands
ol copies. In It ho confined the application
of his theory to animals and
plants, and passed by man. About two
and a half years ago, however, ho published
another work called ."The Descent
of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex,"
in which he in the most unequivocal manner
applies his doctrine to the human
race, la the same line are his "Animals
and Plants under Domestication," and i
"The Expression of the Emotions in Man
and Animals." While the prominence of
Darwin In connection with tUs tbeory
has been such that it is called after him,
he is not alone in its adoption. The num- j
bcr ol persons who can fairly claim h j
place in the ranks of scientific men and i
who have received it is much .smaller
both in Europe and America than many
of the lees learned would suppose. Still
there are enough of them to command
serious attention. A. K. Wallace prdponnded
the hypothesis about the same
time with Darwin, and stillisanadvocatsi
ol It though with some limitations. Herbert
Spenct'r In hia "Principles of Biology"
eargerly endorse* it and uses It for
the purposes of his system ot philosophy.
Others whose names are lesa familiar to
th? general public could alio be mentioned
a3 its adherents.
the two great u? of darwinism.
Tho general hypothesis ol Darwinism
la that all plants and animals, including
man, came from one or a few species by
tho operation of certain natural laws. Of
these laws, it is held that there are two.
The first Is called Natural Selection Tho
word Kchction Id this phase is calculated
to convey to the mind of the uninitiated
the idea that the plant or animal concerned
exercises some choice In the matter.
But the word natural is used to qualify
it, for the purpose ot guarding against
such a construction. The whole phase
indicates a process from, which everything
amounting to an intelligent choice
of the end attained is excluded. This law
may bo better understood by its other
name of the Survival of the Filtat When
plants and animals greatly multiply, as
they ever tend to do, there is a struggle
lor existence. In that struggle the strongest,
that Is those which are best adapted
to the circumstances, survive and the
weaker perish. And aa a consequence
those species which are the strongest are
perpetuated, and the peculiarities in
which their strength lies are developed
until they become new species. By this
process of a few primordial germs the
plants and animals of our era ot the world
have been in the Ispse of ages produced.
The other of the laws is oalled Sexual
Selection. It is supposed to come into exercise
along with natural selection in the
origin of animals and of man." 80 prominent
is it held to bo in this sphere that
tha ..-I 41 r
tuu vvuoiuciaviuu Ul ll MUUUpiCB lUtCC*
fourths of the work of Darwin on the J
"Descent ol Man." It is there treated as
a corner stone with which the whole edi- J
fice stands or falls. To it we as men are t!
supposed to owe our power of song and 8
our hairlessneaa ot body and much that
distinguishes us from the beasts. To it
also he attributes the rise and conserve- lion
of the various races of the human t
species.
Under.the head ol sexual selection, Dar- r
win includes two distinct processes. One1
ol these applies to the male, and the e
other to the female. The mate, who is j
endowed with superior strength and activity,
drives away rivals and thereby
succeeds in perpetuating and still further 1
developing tho peculiarities by which he ii
is distinguished. This, however, is sub- c
stattially the same thing in its operation t
as natural selection and may be so treat-
ed in the discussion. The process as to j
the female is a practical preference for u
certain males on account of some such
quality as beauty of form, or color, or a
odor, or voice. In mating she chooses c
them because ol these things, and thereby a
perpetuates and still further develnpis
them, until as a result new species arise
TUB OIliaiN OP MAN. t
By the operation ol these principles all J
plants and animals are supposed to have
been derived from ono or more primor- 1
dial germs. Any complete discussion ol
Darwinism therefore must range over the r
whole field of organic existences. But
by the application of the hypothesis to I
man the subject is brought directly home
to ourselves as a raco. The following ia 8
the conclusion to which Darwin comes. 1
It is stated in his own language: "We
thus learu that man is descended from a
hairy quadruped, furnished with a tail,
and pointed cars, probably arboreal in its
habits, and an inhabitant of the Old
World. This creature, if its whole struc- 8
turo bad been examined by a naturalist,
would have been classed among the quod-
rumana, a* surely as would the common
and still more ancient marsulllal anima',
and this through a long line of diversified
lorms, either from some reptile-like or
some amphibian-like creature, and this
again Irom some fish-like animal Id the 8
dim obscurity or the past we can see that
tho early progenitor ol all the vertebrata j
must have been an aquatic animal provld-
ed with branchia, with the twoiexeannit- S
cd in tho same individual, and with the J
mostilmportantjorgansof the body (such t
as the brain and heart) imperfectly devel-
oped. This animal seems to have been J
more like the larvae of our existing ma-
fine ascidtana than any other known
form. By the same general process our
Si12?.lual P?wera fid general moral
disposition have been undeveloped aocording
to this theory.
,THK QUESTION AT ISSUE.
Soch ist fair statement of Darwinism J
and its fundamental principles. In de- S
elding for or against its truth, the query I
Is not whether any tuch principles at nat- J
ural selection and sexual selection obtain o
in nature. This is not denied by any
competent ludge. One great service of
Darwinism is that it bat so distinctly

principles. Bat the question U whether c
tho origin of species is to bo traced to the
operation of these laws; and especially
whether by their operation nan has teen
developed more nearly frbra an ape and
more remotely from tho lowest terms ol
animal existence? Are we In body, mind,
and soul the Qflipring of the beasts, from
whom We are still sot separated by any
essential difference of nature? Tho response
of the writer will be an unequivocal
negative.</text>

	<text>THE DEATH OF DAKWIX.
Ill* I.He and Works.
Charles R. Darwin, whose death was announced
yesterday, was born In Shrewsbury England.
February 12th, 1809, where he received the
el?n e its of his education at the local grammar
school. Mr. Darwin went iu 1S35 to the University
of Edinburgh, whence, afler two years of
study, he went to Christ's College. Cambridge.
At the latter place he took his degree In 1831,
and the same year volunteered as naturalist
aboard the Bea-le In its exploring expedition
nr<>und the world. The publication in
1839 of an account of his discoveries
in natural history and geology while on this
voyage was the beginning of a career
ol authorship extending through forty-three
years. A large number of books and papers
"from his pen on scientific subjects had appeared
when. in 1859. his fainons work on '-Origin of
Species by Means of Natural Selection" was
published. In it Mr. Darwin attempted to
account for the diverse forms of life on the
globe on a theory of continuous development
from simpler structures,without the intervention
of special creative flats at the origin of each
species. Large deductions were drawn by
others frmn the principles laid down, and
"Dfir.vini.sm" became the subject or hot
debate. A catalogue of the literature of
Darwinism contains 86 octave pasres of the
titles of books and 312 names of authors. In
1871 appeared ''The Descent of Man, and
Selection In Kelation to Sex*" a work complementary
to that on the origin of species. In 1
this work it was sought to prove that man is
descended from a lower order of animal?"from
a hairy quadru|>ed. furnished with a tail and
Krinted ears, probably arboreal in its habits."
r. Darwin is not, however, authority for the
doctrine that man is descended from the monkey.
so often credited to him. Nor can he be
considered the father of the doctrine of evolution,
though he was one of Its principal supporters.
Iu this, as in other fields, the Greeks
had anticipated modern thought. The first to
torin a distinct hypothesis of evolution in modern
times was Lamarck, a Frenchman, who In
1809 published his views, and Mr. Herbert
Spencer was the first to systematize it into a
philosophy of general application. Mr. Darwin
was famous for his habit of patient and careful
investigation, and with little turn for speculation,
confined himself to his studies iu natural
history and zoology.
WHAT DARWINISM IS.
Reducing the conception to the greatest possible
precision, Herbert Spencer defines evolu
tion as a change froin the homogeneous to the
heterogenec us, from the general to the special^
from the indefinite and simple to the definite
and complex. On this hypothesis, the universe
as it now exist is the result of an almost infinite
series of chances, "relat ed to and dej enient
upon each other, as successive steps, or rather
irrowths. constituting a progress analogous to
the unfolding or evolving of the parts of a
growing organism." This process of development
is considered to be "traceable in the formation
ut'tiie worlds in space, in the multiplication
of the types and species of plant3 and animals
on the globe, in the origination and diverity
of languages, literature, arts and sciences,
and in all the changes of human institutions
and society." In biology, as at present
employed, evolution is a general name tor "the
history of the steps by which any living being
has acquired the morphological and the physiological
characters which distinguish it.
No exception is* at this time, known to the
general law. established upon an immense multitude
of direct'observations, that every living
thing is evolved frotn a particle of matter in
which no trace of the distinctive characters of
the adult form of that living thing is dlseernable."
The doctriue of evolution, however, is
not identical with Darwinism, a term which
came iuto current use with the publication of
Mr. Darwin's "The Origin of Species" and
"The Descent of Man
Darwinism Is one of the attempts to explain
the law or manner of evolution, finding the
cause of the differentiation of species to lie in
the struggle of the organism to adapt itself to
the constantly altering conditions of its environment.
These conditions of external life act
on plants and animals in their natural state
with an effect analogous to that by which artificial
cultivation or breeding by man can change
and improve the characteristics of the different
domestic plants and animals. This process of
the operation of natural circumstances, by
which those varieties or individuals best adapted
to their surroundings of climate, station, character
of soil, food-supply and the number and
kind of living being competing in the "struggle
for existence." are preserved ihe longest in life,
was called by Mr. Darwin "natural selection."
But he not only saw that the constant battle for
life going on among living creatures must be a
"winnowing and improving process, those least
adapted to the situation giving way before
those better adapted; it was his merit to
discover that natural selection is capable of projntciiig
fitness between organisms and their circumstanccs.
and of discerning the importance
of the consequences that follow." Fromthe almost
general admission of naturalists that natural
selection was potent in the production of
varieties in species, Mr. Darwin went further,
aud held that one species sprang from anoth?r
"bv al one continued process of slow variation
and natural selection."
DARWIN'S THEORY OF EVOLUTION.
The article on "Evolution" in the Encyclopaedia
Brltannica, written by Professor Huxley and
James Sully, has the following regarding Mr.
Darwin:
The honor of working out this theory of evolution
on a substantial basis of fact belontrs to
England. Of the writers who have achieved this
result Mr. Darwin deserves the first notice.
Though modestly confining himself to the problem
of accounting for the evolution of the higher
organic forms out of the lower. Mr. Darwin has
done much to further the idea of a gradual evolution
of the physical world. The philosophical
significance of* the hypothesis of natural selection,
especially associated with Mr. Darwin, is
due. as Professor Uehnholtz points out, to the
fact that it Introduces a strictly mechanical conception
in order to accouut for those intricate
arrangements known as organic adaptations
which had before been conceived only in ateleological
manner..By viewing adaptations as conditions
of self-preservation Mr. Darwin is able to
explain how it is that the seemingly purposeful
abounds in organic nature. In so doing he has
done much to eliminate the teleological method
from biology. It is true that in his conception
of seemiugly spontaneous variations and of correlations
of growth he leaves room for the old
manner of viewing organic developments as controlled
by some internal organizing principle.
Yet his theory, as a whole, is clearly a heavy
blow to the teleological method.
Again. Mr. Darwin has trreatlv extended th?
scope of mechanical Interpretation by making
intelligible, apart firora the co-operation of intelligent
purpose, the genesis of the organic
world as a harmonious system ot distinct
groups, a unity in variety, having certain wellmarked
typical affinities. How greatly this arrangement
lias helped to support the idea ot an
ideal plan, we have had occasion to observe.
Mr. Darwin, in his doctrine of the organic world
as a survival, refers this appearance of systematic
plan to perfectly natural causes, and in so
doing he gives new meaning to the ancient
theory that the harmony of the world arises out
of discord. Once more," Mr. Darwin's hypothesis
is of wide philosophic interest, since it'helps to
support the idea of a perfect gradation in the
progress of things. The variations which he
postulates are alight, If not infinitesimal. and
only effect a sensible functional dr morphological
change after they have been frequently repeated
and accumulated by heredity.
Mr. Darwin's later work, in which he applies
his theory of the origin ot species to man, is a
valuable contribution to a naturalistic conception
of human development. The mind of man
in Its lowest stages of development is here
brought into close Juxtaposition to the animal
mind, and the upward progress of man is viewed
as effected by natural causes, chief among which
Is the action of natural selection. Mr. Darwin
does not inquire into the exact way in which
the mental and the bodily are connected. He
simply assumes tiiat, just as the bodily organism
is capable of varying in an indefinite number of
wavs. so may the mental faculties vary indei
finitely in correspondence with certain physical
changes. la this way he seeks to account for
all the higher mental powers, as the use of
language and reason, the sentiment of beauty
j and conscience.
Finally, Mr. Darwin seeks to give a practical
and ethical turn to his doctrine. He appears to
make the end of evolution the conscious end of
man's action, since he defines the general good
as "the rearing of the greatest number of Individuals
in lull health and vigor, and with all
their faculties perfect, under the conditions to
which they are subject." Further, In his view
of the future of the race, Mr. Darwin leans to
the idea that the natural process which has
effected man's first progress must continue to be
an Important factor in evolution, and that consequently,
it is not well to check the scope of
this process by undue restraints of population
and a charitable preservation of the incompetent.
TBI PHILOSOPHER AT HOME.
Trom Um London Truth.
A great peal of laughter fills the modest house
at Down. Not on* of these sharp metallic each" 1
tsnations which jar on the ear and set the teeth I
like the crackling of thorns under a pot, nor yet
the {ond laugh which speaks the Tacant mind,
but a rich Homeric langh, round and foil, musical
and jocund?a laugh to remember. The outburst
or merriment proceeds from the recluse of
Down, infinitely amused to hear that, while he
has been watching the tendrils of the vine and
examining the predatory habits of the sundew,
the microscope of The World has been focussed
upon the great observer himself; that, without
going through the preliminary process of pinntng
him to a cork like a cockchafer, he has been a
marked man for some time past; that when he
has imagined himseltmost secure atthe pleasant
bouse of his friend. Dr. Farr, discussing the light
and exhilarating subject of vital statistics, the
same penetrating orb was stilled fixed upon
him; that in the little garden where he
cultivated his plants for experiment,
"observation with extended view," was at his
elbow. "It is better so," says Mr. Darwin,
"than to be Interviewed and harassed with
questions which cannot be answered without
some appearance of vanity. Moreover it strikes
me as not proper that a man should communicate
anything to the author of a biographical
notice. He should behave as It already dead."
On any subject but himself he is the most free
and communicative of living philosophers.
Without an atom of scientific jealousy, he is
alwayB ready to expound his views, to narrate
the result of the delicate experiments on which
he is perpetually occupied and to asssist other
investigators from the stores of an experience
that has ranged over the whole field of natural
science and the conclusions of a mind trained to
reason closely on such facts as have been ascertained
by actual observation. No naturalist of
this or any other tim? has confined himself more
strictly to well-ascertained facts and devoted
more labor to original investigation. The
reason of this excessive care is to be
found in the keystone of the Darwinian
philosophy?La verite quand meme; the pursuit
of truth through all tlifflculties and without
regard to consequences. To this object be has
devoted his entire life, saving, of course, the
cheerful hours speut in his family circle?one of
the most united and affectionate in England?
and with his oldest friends. Sir Joseph Hooker
and Professor Huxley. Perhaps no merrier trio
of philosophers ever gathered together and enlivened
abstruse subjects with quaint quip and
crank, but neither of his two friends, genial
companions though they be, can approach Mr.
Darwin's pitch of hilarity. At a droll illustration
of Mr. Huxley's or a humorous doubt insinuated
in the musical tones of the president
of the Royal Society, the e3*es twinkle under
the massive overhanging brows, the Rocratic
head, as Professor Tyndall loves to call it, is
thrown back, and over the long white beard
rolls out sucti a laugh as we have attempted to
describe. Unfortunately there ar? moments
when Mr. Darwin can enjoy neither scientific
investigation nor friendly cjnverse; when sodden
fits of illness, to which he has been subject
since his manhood, lay him prostrate for days
together. Happily these attacks are only troublesome
while they last, and inflict no permanent
injury on his powerful frame. The long
wakeful periods of convalescence, too, are utilized
for observations which require almost constant
attention; so that the tables Inay be said
to be turned ou disease.
Mr. Darwin, like his friend Sir Joseph Hooker,
is an instance of hereditary transmission of peculiar
characteristics. He is the third of his
family in direct descent who have been fellows
of the Royal Society. He is the son of Dr. Robert,
Waring Darwin, F. R. S., and grandson of
Dr. Erasmus Darwin, author of "The Botanic
Garden," "Zoonomia, etc.,and by the mother's
side is grandson of Josiah Wedgwood. F, It. S.,
the celebrated manufacturer of pottery, and
founder of the works at Ktrur'a. In him. how
ever, the artistic element which dominated the
Wedswoods h&H beeu almost entirely overshadowed
by the scientific instinct which impels man
to fceek for knowledge for its own sake, without
the slightest admixture of interest or ambition.
For sculpture or pottery, or even for drawing,
except as an aid to botanical and zoological pursuits.
he cares very little, his collection of pictures
being confined to a portrait of old Dr. Darwin
and one of Joaiaii Wedgwood, hanging In
his dining room, and sketches of Sir Joseph
Hooker and Professor Huxley in the small study
whence have issued the "Origin of Species," the
"Descent of Man," and a large number of equally
valuable but less generally known works on
zoology, botauy aud geology. It is the fate of Mr.
Darwin, like that of many other celebrated men.
to be best kuown by the works which he would
himself hardly assign the highest rank among his
many productions. The popular mind, smitten
with a taste for a smattering of science, naturally
pounces most eagerly upon those scientific
words which approach the borderland of speculation.
and has thus done him but scant justice;
the hurrying and blundering millions not
pausing to distinguish between those statements
which he puts forward as matters ot fact, ascertained.
beyfcnd all possibility of doubt, by experiment,
and the hypotheses which 'with
admirable caution he sometimes bases upon
them. This is grossly unfair to the most candid
of philosophers, who cares nothing for his theories,
and, as in the well-known case of the
bees in the' "Origin of Species,"
frankly admitted the difficulty of reconciling
the phenomena of nature with
his hypothesis of divergence. Thus it is
not uncommon to hear persons of supposed
sc.entilic taste, who chatter glibly enough about
protoplasm and the monad, compare Mr. Darwin's
most popular works with the "Vestiges of
Creation," a mere ^scientific romance, founded
on the daring speculations of Lamarck and the
nebular theory of Laplace, the famous astronomer,
who, when asked by Napoleon why he did
not attribute the structure of the universe to
one great architect, is said to have replied that
he "had no occasion to adopt that hypothesis."
Mr. Darwin's books are founded upon no hasty
generalization irom facts collected by others,
but on patient and independent observation.
Yet so persistent have been his labors that a
mere catalogue of them would fill a column In
this journal. Since his return from the memorable
voyage of the Beagle he has been constantly
present to the scientific world. It was a
happy thought of Captain Fitz lloy to offer, on
setting out in 1831. to give up part of his own
cabin to any naturalist who would accompany
the ship on"her now historic survey. Mr. Darwin
had Just taken his degree at Cambridge, his
preliminary studies having been made at
Shrewsbury school, under Dr. Butler (afterward
bishop 0( Litchfield), and then for two years at
the University of Edinburgh, when he devoted
some time to marine zoulogy. and read his first
papers before the Plinian society on the movement
of the ova of Flustra. On hearing of Captain
Fitz Roy's offer he at once volunteered his
services without salary, but on-condition that
he should have the entire disposal of bis collections,
all of which be deposited in the various
public institutions.
His various work covers an immense area of
thought, extending over zoology, botauy and
geology, in each of which he has made the 'mark
of an original and powerful mind enricheu by
long research. The bulk of work of this kind
conveys but the dimmest idea of the toil involved

been carefully collected, arranged and duly
pondered over.
In ono respect, despite his vexatious attacks
of Illness, Mr. Darwin must be considered a fortunate
man. Durinsr the whole of his life he
has been in easy circumstances; above the toil
of earning an income. Unlike many philosophers,
he has not had the mortification of spending
his best hours In the drudgery of official
routine or the hardly less wearisome task of
teaching. He has been enabled to devote his
entire time to his favorite pursuits, and since
his marriage with his cousin. Miss Emma Wedgewood,
has resided at Down, amid the rich and
vailed scenery of one of the prettiest parts of
Kent. As his numerous family has grown up
around him he has been relieved of all the cares
which distract the scientific worker In the heat
and turmoil of active life. He leads a truly
calm and philosophic existence, unvexed by the
contemplation of weekly bills and the signing
of checks. In bis wife and family he is especially
happy, being spared the pain of degenerate
offspring. His eldest son, William Darwin,
is a banker Southampton; the second. George,
took high honors at Cambridge, and Is now a
Fellow of Trinity; the third, Frank, who has
inherited his father's ill-health, acts as his secretary;
the fourth. Leonard, is an officer in the
artillery, and distinguished himself as one of
the sc entific corns sent to observe the transit
of Venus; the fifth, Horace, is an excellent
mathematician. One married and one unmarried
daughter complete a family whose constant
care is to relieve its head of all possible trouble
or anxiety.
Thus, free from the disturbing influences of
the world, he can well afford to treat with admirable
good humor the attacks of scientific
opponents, and the jokes of ignorant folk incapable
of understanding either bis books or
himself. When young he pursued field sports
with combined interest of the hunter and the
naturalist; but of late years he has found bis
chief relaxation in reading the popular novels of
the day, feeling Hke AUguste Comte, that the
scientific bow requires frequent unbending. In
the treatment of books and specimens be resembles
Mr. Carlyie?caring nothing for them
when read or thoroughly investigated. His
books and plants are always at the service of his
friends and neighbors, among whom one of the
nearest la Sir John Lubbock. Finally, let It be
of absolute truth at all hazards, he abhors tampering
with or shaping facts to suit preconceived
theories. It is. perhaps, hardly too much to say
that no man has exercised a more powerful influence
on the study of natural history since
Aristotle himself.</text>

the First Cans,
of Everything,
In the following sermon, the ques
tion of human origin, so prominent
In religious circles to-day, is discussed
by Dr. Talmage in his characteristic
and forcible style. The text is Tim
othy 6: 20: "O Timothy, keep that
which is committed to thy trust, avoid
ing oppositions of science falsely so
called."
There is no contest between genuine
science and revelation. The same Clod
who by the hand of prophet wrote on
parchment, by the hand of the storm
wrote on the rock. Tne best tele
scopes and microscopes and electric
batteries and nhilosonhical apparatus
belong to Christin universities. Who
gave us mugnetic telegraphy? Pro
fessor Morse, a Christian. Who swung
the lightnings under the sea, cabling
the continents together? Cyrus W.
Field, the Christian. Who discovered
the anesthetical properties of chloro
form, doing more for the relief of hu
man pain than any man that ever
lived, driving back nine-tenths of the
horrors of surgery; James Y. Simpson,
of Edinburgh, as eminent for piety as
for science; on week days in the uni
versity lecturing on profoundest sci
entific subjects, and on Sabbaths
preaching the tiospel of Jesus Christ
to the masses of Edinburgh. I saw the
universities of that city draped in
mourning for his death, and I heard
his eulogy pronounced by the desti
tute populations of the Cowgate. Sci
ence and revelation are the bass and
soprano of the same tune. The whole
world will yet acknowledge the com
plete harmony. But between what my
text describes as science falsely so
called, and revelation, there is an un
compromising vvar, and one or the
other must go under.
At the present time the air is filled
with social and platform and pulpit
talk about evolution, and it is high
time that the people who have not
time to make investigation for them
selves understand that evolution in
the first place, is up anu down, out-
and-out infidelity; in the second place
it is contrary to the facts of science,
and in the third place, that it is bru
talizing in its tendencies. I do not
argue that this is a genuine book, I
do not say the Bible is worthy of any
kind of credence those are subjects
for other Sabbaths but I want you to
understand that Thomas Paine and
Hume and Voltaire no more thorough
ly disbelieved the Hc!y Scriptures than
do all the leading scientists who be
lieve in evolution. And when I say
scientists, of course, I do not mean
literary men or theologians who in
essay or in sermon, and without giving
their life to scientific investigation,
look at the subject on this side or that.
By scientists I mean those who have
a specialty in mat direction, ana wno,
through zoological garden and aquar
ium and astronomical observatory,
give their life to the study of the
physical earth, its plants and its ani
mals, and the regions beyond so far
as optical instruments b:.ve explored
them.
I put upon the witness stand living
and dead the leading evolutionists
Ernst Heckel, John Stuart Mill, Hux
ley, Tyndall, Darwin, Spencer. On the
witness stand, ye men of science, liv
ing' and dead, answer these questions:
Do you believe the Holy Scriptures?
No. And so they say all. Do you be
lieve the Bible story of Adam and
Eve in the Garden of Eden? No. And
so they say all. Do you believe the
miracles of the Old and New Testa
ment? No. And so they say all. Do
you believe that Jesus Christ died to
save the nations? o. And so they
say all. Do you believe in the regen
erating power of the Holy Ghost? No.
And so they say all. Do you believe
that human supplication directed
Heavenward ever makes any differ
ence? No." And so they say all.
Now, I put opposite to each other, to
show that evolution is infidelity, the
Bible account of how the human race
started, and the evolutionist account
of how the human race started. Bible
account: "God said, let us make man
in 0 r image. God created man in his
own image; male and female created
he them." He breathed into them, the
breath of life, the whole story setting
forth the idea that it was not a perfect
kangaroo, or a perfect orang outang,
but a perfect man. That is the Bible
account. Away back in the ages there
were four or .five primal germs, or
seminal spores from which all the liv
ing creatures have evolved. Go away
back, and there you will nnd a vege
table stuff that might be called
mushroom. This mushroom by

pole, the tadpole by innate force

velops into a quadruped, the quadru
ped develops into a baboon, the baboon
develops into a man.
Darwin says that the human hand is
only a nsn s nn acveiopeu. lie says
that the human lungs are only a swim
bladder showing that we once floated
or were amphibious. He says the hu
man ear could once have been moved
Dy xorce oi win just as a norse nits
its ear at a frightful object. He says
the human race were originally web-
footed. From primal germ to tadpole
from tadpole to fish, from fish to rep
tile, from reptile to wolf, from wolf to
chimpanzee, and from chimpanzee to
man. Now If anybody says that the
Bible account of the starting of the
1 human race and the evolutionist ac
count of tne starting of the human
race are the same accounts, he makes
an appalling misrepresentation.
Prefer if you will Darwin's "Origin
of the Species" to the Book of Genesis,
but know you axe an infidel. A for
myself, as Herbert Spencer was not
present at the creation and the Lord
Almighty was present, I prefer to take
the divine account as to what really
occurred on that occasion. To show
that this evolution is only an attempt
to eject God and to postpone him and
to put him clear out of reach, I ask
a question or two. The baboon made
the man, and the wolf made the ba
boon, and the reptile made the quadru
ped, and the fish made the reptile, and
the tadpole made the fish, and the
primal germ made the tadpole. Who
made the primal germ? Most of the
evolutionists say: "We don't know."
Others say it made itself. Others say
it was spontaneous generation., There
is not one of them who will fairly and
openly and frankly and emphatically
say: "God made it."
To show you that evolution is infi
del, I place the Bible account of how
the brute creation was started oppo
site to the evolutionist's account of the
way the brute creation was started.
Bible account: You know that the
Bible tells how that the birds were
made at one time, and the cattle made
at another time, and the fish made at
another time, and that each brought
forth after its kind. Evolutionist's
account: From four or five primal
germs or seminal spores all the living
creatures evolved. Hundreds of thou
sands of species of insects, or reptiles,
or beasts, of fish, from four germs
a statement flatly contradicted not
only in the Bible, but the very A B
C of science. A species never develops
into anything but its own species. In
all the ages and in all the world there
has never been an exception to it. The
shark never comes of a whale, nor the
pigeon of the vulture, nor the butter
fly of a wasp. Species never cross
over. II tnere be an attempt at it it is
hybrid, and the hybrid is always ster
ile and has no descendants.
To show that evolution is infidel I
place also the Bible account of how
worlds were made opposite the evolu
tionist's account of how worlds were
made. Bible account: God made two
great lights the one to rule the day;
the other to rule the night; he made
the stars also. Evolutionist account:
Away back in the ages there was a fire
mist or star dust, and this fire mist
cooled off into granite, and then this
granite by earthquake and by storm
and by light was shaped into
mountains and valleys and seas, and
so what was originally fire mist be
came what we call the earth.
Who made the first mist? Who set
the fire mist to world-making? Who
cooled off the first mist into granite?
Agassiz says: "The manner in which
the evolution theory in zoology is
treated would lead those who are not
special zoologists to suppose that ob
servations have been made by which
it can be inferred that there is in na
ture such a thing as change among
organized beings actually taking
place. There is no such thing on rec
ord. It is shifting the ground of ob
servation from one field of obser
vation to another to make this
statement, and when the assertions
go so far as to exclude from the do
main of science those who will not be
dragged into this mire of mere asser
tion then it is time to protest."
With equal vehemence against the
doctrine of evolution Hugh Miller,
Farraday, Brewster, Dana, Dawson,
and hundreds of scientists in this
country and other countries have
made protest. I know that the few
men who have adopted the theory
make more noise than the thousands
who have rejected it. The Bothnia, of
the Cunard line, took five hundred
passengers safely from New York to
Liverpool. Not one of the five hun
dred made any excitement. But after
we had been four days out, one morn
ing we found on deck a man's hat and
coat and vest and boots, implying that
some one had jumped overboard.
Forthwith we all began to talk about
that one man. There was more talk
about that one man overboard than all
the five hundred passengers that rode
cn in safety.
Here is the glorious and magnificent
theory that God by his omnipotent
power made man, and by his omnipo
tent power made the brute creation,
and by his omnipotent power made all
worlds, and five hundred scientists
have taken passage on board that mag
nificent theory, but ten or fifteen hove
jumped overboard. They make more
talk than all the five hundred that did
not jump. I am politely asked to jump
with them. Thank you, gentleman, I
am very much obliged to you. I think
I shall stick to the old Cunarder. If
you want to jump overboard, jump,
and test for yourselves whether your
hand was really a fish's fin, and
whether you were web-footed origin
ally, and whether your lungs are a
swim bladder. And as in every experi
ment there must be a division of labor,
some who experiment and some who
observe, you make the experiment and
I will observe!
There Is one tenet of evolution
which it is demanded we adopt, that
which Darwin calls "Natural Selec
tion," and that which Wallace calls
the "Survival of the Fittest." By this
they mean that the human race and
the brute creation are all the time im
proving because the weak die and the
strong live. Those who do not survive
because1 they are the fittest. They say
the breed of Rheep and cattle and dogs
and men is all the time improving, na
turally improvirg. No need of God, or
any Bible, or any religion, but just
natural progress.
You see the race started with "spon
taneous generation," and then it goes
right oil until Darwin can take us up
with his "natural selection," and Wal
lace with his "survival of the fittest,"
and so we go right on up forever. Beau
tiful! But do the fittest survive? Gar
field died in September Guiteau sur
viving until the following June. "Sur
vival of the fittest?" Ah! no. The
martyrs, religious and political, dying
for their principles, tiielr bloody per
secutors living on to old age. "Sur
vival of the fittest?" Five hundred
thousand brave Northern men march
ing out to meet five hundred thousand
brave Southern men, and die on the
battlefield for a principle. Hundfedi
of thousands of them went down into
the grave trenches. We stayed at
home in comfortable quarters. Did
they die because they were not as
fit to live as we who survived? Ah!
no; not the "survival of tha fittest."
How lias It been In the families of
the world? How was it with the child
physically the strongest, intell actually
the brightest, in disposition tie kind
est? Did that child die because it was
not as fit to live as those of your fam
ily that survived? Not "the survival
of the fittest." In all communities
some of the noblest, grandest men
dying in youth, or in mid-life, while
some of the meanest and most con
temptible live on to old age. Not "the
survival of the fittest."
But to show you that this doctrine
is antagonistic to the Bible and to
common sense I have only to prove to
you that there has been no natural
progress. Vast improvement from
another source, but mind you, no nat
ural progress. Where is the fine horse
in any of our parks whose picture of
eye and mane and nostril and neck
and haunches is worthy of being com
pared to Job's picture of a horse as he
thousands of years ago heard it paw
and neigh and champ its bit for the
battle? Pigeons of to-day not so wise
as the carrier pigeons of 500 years ago
pigeons that carried the mails from
army to army and from city to city;
one of them flung into the sky at
Borne or Venice landing without ship
or railtrain in London. Look at the
great animals that walked the earth in
olden times animals compared with
which in size pur elephant is a cat
monsters of olden times that swam
the deep, compared with which our
whale is a minnow. Conies have
learned nothing about climbing and
the hounds nothing about hunting,
and the ostrich nothing about hatch
ing, and the condor nothing about fly
ing, and the owl nothing about music
al cadences for six thousand years,
Not a particle of progress.
And as to the human race, so far as
mere natural progress is concerned,
once there were men ten feet high;
now the average is about five feet six
inches. It started with men living two
hundred, four hundred, eight hun
dred, nine hundred years, and now
thirty years is more than the average
of human life. Mighty progress we
have made, haven't we? I went into
the cathedral at York, England, and
the best artists in England had just
been painting a window in that ca
thedral, and right beside it was a win
dow painted four hundred years ago,
and there is not a man on earth but
would say that the modern painting of
the window by the best artists of
England is not worthy of being com
pared with the painting four hundred
years ago right beside it. Vast im
provement, as I shall show you in
minute or two, but no natural evo
lution.
What is remarkable about this thing
is, it is all the time developing its dis
honesty. In our day it is ascribing
this evolution to Herbert Spencer and
Charles Darwin. It is a dishonesty,
Evolution was known and advocated
hundreds of years before these gentle
men began to be evolved. The Phoe
nicians thousands of years ago de
clared that the human race wobbled
out of the mud. Democritus, who lived
4G0 years before Christ remember
that knew this doctrine of evolution
when he said: "Everything is com
posed of atoms, or infinitely small ele
ments, each with a definite quality,
form, and movement, whose inevitable
union and separation shape all differ
ent things and forms, laws and efforts,
and dissolve them again for new com
binations. The gods themselves and
the human mind originated from such
atoms. There are no casualties. Every
thing is necessary and determined by
the nature of the atoms which have
certain mutual affinities, attractions,
and repulsions." Anoximander cen
turies ago declared that the human
race started at the place where the sea
saturated the earth.
I am not a pessimist but an op
timist. I do not believe everything is
going to destruction: I believe every
thing is going on to redemption. But
it will not be through the infidel doc
trine of evolution, but through our
glorious Christianity which has ef
fected all the good that has ever been
wrought and which is yet to recon
struct all the nations.
What is that in the offing? A ship
gone on the rocks at Cape Hatteras,
The hulk is breaking up, crew and
passengers are drowning. The storm
is in full blast and the barometer is
still sinking. What does that ship
want? Development. Develop her
broken masts. Develop her broken
rudder. Develop her drowning crew,
Develop her freezing passengers. De
velop the whole ship? That 1b all it
wants. Development. Oh, I make
mistake. What that ship wants is
life-boat from the shore. Leap into it,
you men of the life station. Pull
away to the wreck. Steady there!
Bring the women and children first to
the shore. Now the stout men. Wrap
them up in flannels, and between their
chattering teeth you can pour resto
ration.
Well, my friends, our world is on
the rocks. God launched it well
enough, but through mispilotage and
the storms of six thousand years
It has gone into the breakers. What
does this old ship of the world want?
Development? There is enough old
evolution in the hulk to evolve another
mast and another rudder and to evolve
all the passengers and evolve the ship
out of the breakers. Development?
Ah! no, my friends, what this old ship
wreck of a world wants is a lifeboat
from the shore. And it is coming,
Cheer, my lads, cheer. It is coming
from the shining shore of Heaven, tak
ing the crests of ten waves with one
sweep of the shining paddles. Christ is
In the lifeboat. Many wounds on hands
and feet and side and brow, showing
he has been long engaged in the work
of rescue, but yet mighty to save to
save ne, to save all, to save forever.
My Lord and my God, get us Into tha
lifeboat! Away with your rotten, de
ceptive, infidel, and blasphemous evolu
tion, and give us the Bible, salvation
through Jesus Christ our Lord.

At the present time the air is filled
with social and platform and pulpit
talk about evolution, and it is high
time that the people who have not
-time to make investigation for them
tiolves understand that evolution in
the first place is up-and-down, out-and-out
infidelity; in the second place it is
contrary to the facts of science, and
In the third place, that It is brutaliz
ing in its tendencies. I do not argue
that this 1b a genuine book, I do not
nay that the llible is worthy of any
kind of credence those are subjects
for other Sabbaths but I want you to
-understand that Thomas Paine and
.Hume and Voltaire no more thoroughly
disbelieved the Holy Scriptures than
tip all the leading scientists who be
lieve in evolution. And when 1 say
ncientlsts, of course, 1 do not mean
literary men or theologians who in
esay or in sermon, and without giv
ing their life to scientific investiga
tions, look at the subject on this Bide
or that. By scientists'I mean those
who have a specialty In that direction
und who, through zoological garden
und aquarium and astronomical observ
atory, give their life to the study of the
physical earth, Its plants and its anl
tools .and the regions beyond so far as
optical instruments have explored
thorn.
I 1 put upon the witness stand living
and dead the leading evolutionists
Ernst Hcckel. John Stuart Mill, Hux
ley, Tyndall, Darwin, Spencer. On
.the witness stand, ye men of science,
living nnd dead, answer these ques
tions: Do you believe the Holy Scrip
tures? No. And so they say all. Do
yon believe the llible story of Adam
und Eve in the garden of Eden? No.
And so they say nil. Do you believe
the miracles of the Old und New Tes
JumentV No. And so they say all.
Do you believe that Jesus Christ died
to save the nations? No. And so
they bay nil. Do yon believe In the
regenerating power of the Holy Ghost?
JNo. And so they say all. Do you be
lieve that human supplication directed
heavenward ever makes any differ
ence? No. And so they say all.
Herbert Spencer, in the only ad
dress he inude in this country, in his
Very first sentence ascribes ills physi
cal ailments to fate, und the author
ized report of that address begins the
wdrd fate with u big "F." J'rof.
'lfipkel, in tho very first page of his
tw6 great volumes, sneers at the lli
ble us' H so-called revolution. Tyndall,
ih Ills famous ipruyer test, delicd the
whole of Christendom to show thut
human supplication mude aify differ
ence1 In the result ot things. John
Stuart Mill wrote elaborately against
Christianity, nnd to show that his re
jection of it was complete, ordered
this epitaph for his tombstone: "Most
unhappy." Huley suld that nt the
first reading of Darwin's book he was
convinced of the fact that teleology
hud received its death blow at the
liund of Mr. Darwin All the leading
ncientlsts who believe In evolution,
without onu exception the world overf
arc. infidel. 1 say nothing uguinst in
fidelity, mind you. 1 only wish to
define the belief and meaning of the
.rejection.
Now, I put opposite each other, to
dhow thut evolution is infidelity, the
liible account of how tho human race
started and the evolutionist account
of how the human race started, lfiblu
account; "Clod said, let us make man
in our image, God created man In Ills
own image; rnulo nnd female created
He them." He breathed into him the
breath of life, the whole story setting
'forth the idea thut it was not u perfect
kangorun, or a perfect nnrnng outnng,
but a perfect limn. That Is the llible
account. The evolutionist account:
Away back in the age there were four
or five primal germs, of seminal spores
from Which all the living creatures
Jmve been evolved. (So uway back, and
thnru you will find u vegetable stuff
that might be called a mushroom. This
mushroom by Innate force develops a
tadpole, the tadpole by Innate force
develops a pollywog, the poly wog de
r"bk
tgspwt
&2L
velops a fish, and tho fish by natural
force develops Into a reptile, tho, rep
tllo develops Into a quadruped, the
quadruped develops Into n baboon, the
balionn develops into a man.
Darwin suys thnl the human hnnd Is
only a fish's fin developed He says
that the human lungs are only a swim
bladder sliowlug that we once floated
or were amphibious. He says the hu
man ear could once have been moved
by force of will just as n horse lifts its
ear nt H frightful object. He says tho
human race were originally web
footed. From primal germ to tad
pole, from tadpole to fish, from fish to
reptile, from reptile to wolf, from
wolf to chimpanzee, and from chim
panzee to man. Now, If anybody says
that the llible account of the starting
of the human raco and tho evolution
ist account of the sturting of the hu
man nice, are the same accounts, he
makes an appalling misrepresentation.
Prefer, If you will, Darwin's "Origin
of the Species' to the Itook of Genesis,
but know you are an lufiel. As for
myself, os Herbert Spencer was not
present nt the creation and the Lord
Almighty was present, I prefer to take
the divine account as to what really
occurred on that occasion. To show
that this evolution is only un attempt
to eject God nnd to postpone Him, nnd
to put Hhn clear out of reach, I ask a
question or two. The baboon made
the man und the wolf made the
baboon, and the reptile made the
quadruped, and the fish made tho rep
tile, nnd the tadpole made the fish,
and the primnl germ mad the tadpole.
Who made the primal germ? Most of
the evolutionists sny: "We don't
know." Others say it made itself.
Others say it was spontaneous genera
tion. There is not one of them who
will fairly and openly and frankly and
emphatically say, "God made it."
The nearest to a direct answer is
that made by Herbert Spencer In
which he says it was mude by the
great "unknowable mystery." lint
here comes Huxley with a cup of pro
toplasm to explain the thing. TIiIb
protoplasm, lie sny, is primal life
giving quality with which the rnco
away back in the ages was btarted.
With his protoplasm he proposes to
explain everything. Dear Mr. Hux
ley, who made the protoplasm?
To show you thut evolution is in
fidel, 1 place the liible account of how
the brute creation was started oppo
site to the evolutionist's account of
the way the brute creation was start
ed, liible account: You know the
Hiblc tells how that the birds were
made at one tunc, nnd the cattle made
at another time, and the fish made nt
another lime, nnd that each brought
forth after its kind. Evolutionist's ac
count: From four or five primal germs
or seminal spores nil the living crea
tures evolved. Hundreds of thousands
of species of Insects, of reptiles, of
beasts, of fish, from four germs n
statement flatly contradicting not
only the llible, but the very A 11 C'of
science. A species never develops In
to anything but its own species. In
all the ages aud In all the world there
has never been un exception to it. The
shark never comes of a whale, nor the
pigeon of a vulture, nor the butterfly
of a wasp. Species never cross over.
If there be nn attempt at it, it is
hybrid, nnd the hybrid is always ster
ile and has no descendants.
These men of science tell us that
100,000 species came from four, when
the law all through the universe is
that, starting In one species It keeps
on In that species, and there would be
only four now if there had been four
nt starting. If I should say to you
that the world is flat, and that a circle
and a square arc the same, and that
twice two make 15, I would come just
as near the truth as when these evolu
tionists tell you thnt 100,000 species
cuine from four. Evolution would
have been left out of the question with
its theory flatly contradicting all ob
servation and all science, had not its
authors and their disciples been so set
on ejecting God from the universe und
destroying the Hlblo thut they will go
to any length though It lead them Into
Idiotic absurdity. You see whut the
llible teaches In regard to it, 1 have
shown yon also whutevolntion teaches
in regard to It.
AgassU says thnt he found In a reef
of Florida the remains of insects 30,
000 years old not three, but 30,000
years old and they were just like the
insects now. There has been no
change. All the fncts of ornithology
and s-oology and Ichthyology and con
chology, but un echo of Genesis first
nnd 21st: "Every winged foul after his
kind." Every ereuture after its kind.
When common observation anl science
corroborate the llible I will not stulti
fy myself by surrendering to the elab
orated guesses of evolutionists.
To show thut evolution is infidel I
place also the llible account of how
worlds were made opposite the evolu
tionist's account of how worlds were
mndc. llible account: God made two
great lights tho one to rule the day,
the other to rule the night; he mude
the stars also. Evolutionist account:
Away back in the ages, there was a
fire mist or star dust, and this fire
mist cooled off into granite, nnd then
ths granite by enrthquuke nnd by
storm nnd by light was shaped into
mountains und valleys and sens, and
so whut was originally fire must be
como what wo call the earth.
Who made tho fire mist? Who sot
tho fire mist to world-muking? Who
cooled oil tho fire mist into granite?
Yon hnve pushed God some 00,000,000
or 70,000,000 miles from the earth, but
He Is too near yet for the health of
evolution,
.So these Infidel evolutionists go wan
dering up und down guessing through
the universe. Anything to push uwny
back Johovah from Ills empire und
muku the one book which Is ills com
munication to the soul of tho human
ruce appear obsolete and delusive. Hut
1 am glad to know that while some of
these scientists have gono Into evolu
tion, there are many that do not be
lieve it. Among thorn, the man who
by most is considered the greatest
scientist wo ever had this Bide of the
water Agasslz, A name thnt makes
every intelligent man the earth over
uncover.
Agassis says: "Themnnner in which
tho evolution theory in zoology Is
treated leads those who nro not special
zoologists to suppose that observations
hnvo been mnde by which it can be in
ferred that thore is in nature such n
thing as change among organized be
ings nctually taking place. There is
no such thing on record. It Is shift
ing tho ground of observation from
one field of observation to another to
mnko this statement, and when the
assertions go so far as to i-xclude from
the domuiu of science those who will
not be dragged Into this mire of mere
assertion then It is time to protest"
There Is one tenet of evolution which
It is demanded we adopt, thut which
Dnrwln calls "Natural Selection,'' and
that which Wnllaee calls the "Sur
vival of the Fittest." llv tlilt they
mean that the human race und the
brute creation are all the time Improv
ing because the weak die and the
strong live. Tho6e who do not die
survive because they are the fittest.
They sny the breed of sheep and cattle
and dogs and men 1b all the time im
proving, naturally improving. No
need of God, or any llible, or any reli
gion, but just natural progress.
You see the race started with "spon
taneous generation,'' and then It goes
right on until Darwin can take us up
with his "natural selection," and Wal
lace with his "survival of the fittest,"
nnd so we go right on up forever.
Heautlfull Hut do the fittest survive?
Garfield dead in September Gulteau
surviving until the following June.
"Survlvnl of the fittest?" Ah! no.
The martyrs, religious and political,
dying for their principles, their bloody
persecutors living on to old age. "Sur
vival of the fittest?" Five hundred
thousand brave northern men march
ing out to meet 600,000 brave southern
men, und die on the battlefield for u
principle. Hundreds of thousands of
them went down into the grave
trenches. We stayed at homo in com
fortable quarters. Did they die be
cause they were not as fit to live as we
who survived? Ah! no; not the "sur
vival of the fittest." Ellsworth and
Nathaniel Lynn falling on the north
ern side. Albert Sidney Johuston nnd
Stonewall Jackson falling on the
southern side. Did they fall because
they were not ns fit to live us the sol
diers nnd the generals who came buck
in safety? No. llltten with the frosts
of the second death be the tongue thut
dares utter It!
lint to show you thnt this doctrine
is antagonistic to the liible und to
common sense I have only to prove to
you that there has been no natural
progress. Vast Improvement from an
other source, but mind you, no natu
ral progress. Whero is the fine horse
In any of our purks whose picture of
eye nnd mnne nnd nostril and neck
und haunches Is worthy of being com
pared to Job's picture of u horse as he
thousands of years ago heard it paw
and neigh und chump its bit for the
buttle? Pigeons of to-day not so
wise us the carrier pigeons of 600
years ago pigeons that carried the
malls from array to army and from
city to city; one of them flung into
the sky at Home or Venice landing
without ship or railtrain In London.
And as to the human race, so far as
mere natural progress Is concerned,
once theie were men ten feet high;
now the average Is about five feet six
Inches. It started with men living 200,
400, bOO, 000 yeurs, aud now So years is
more than the average of human life.
Mighty progress we huve made, haven't
we? 1 went Into the cathedral at
York, Eng., and the best artists in
England had just been painting a win
dow In that cathedrul, und right be
side it wns u window painted -100 years
ago, and there is not a man on eurth
but would say that the modern paint
ing of the window by the best artists
of England Is not worthy of being
compared with the painting of 400
years ago right beside It. Vust Im
provement, as 1 shall show you in a
minute or two, but no nuturnl evolu
tion. Look nt China, where evolution has
had full swing for thousands of years
uninterrupted by any thing except here
und there a mission station with this
defunct book, the llible, but through
the most of the realm not Interfered
with. What has evolution done for
China',' Christian civilization goes in
and builds a railroad; they tear it up.
For 1,000 years the Chinese nntlon,
where it is now Invaded by the gospel,
has not made one five hundredth mil
lion part of nn inch of advancement.
They Worship the- same gods of red
paint. Just us always, they drown the
female children us u nuisance. Just us
always, they eat with chop sticks. So
In India, so In Arabia, so in Turkey, so
everywhere where the gospel has not
inude an invasion.
I tell you, my friends, the natural
evolution Is not upward, but It Is
always downward. Hear Christ's ac
count of It. Matthew 16., 10: "Out of
the heart proceed evil thoughts, mur
ders, adulteries, fornications, thefts,
false witness.-blasphemies." That Is
whut Christ said of evolution, Give
nntural .evolution full swing in our
world 4nd it will evolve luto two hem
ispheres of crime, two hemispheres of
penitentiary, two hemispheres of laz
aretto, two hemispheres of brothel,
New York Tombs, Moynmenslng
prison, Philadelphia; Seven Dials, Lc n
don, and Cowgate, Edtnbiirg, only fes
tering carbuncles on the fuee and neck
of nuturnl evolution. 'See what the Hi 0e
says about tho heart, and then what
evolution says about the heart. Evolu
tion buys "better nnd better and better
gets tho heart by natural improve
ment." Tho Hlblo says: "The heart W
deceitful above all things, nnd desper
ately wicked. Who can know It?"
When you can evolve fragrance from
raulador, and can evolve un oratorio
from a burzsuw, and can evolve fall
plplns from u basket of decayed crab
apples, then you can by natural evolu
tion from tho human heart develop
goodness! Oh! my friends, natural
evolution Is always downward; it i
never upward.

"More Letter* of Charles Darwin." t>. Xf
pie ton Co., New York. Two volumes. Prte*
95 net.
The discussion concerning the power of
nature to "select" raised, of course. th»
older problem of the extent to which ln
telligtnt "design" is evident in nature.
On that point Darwin wrote to Hooker:
"Your conclusion that all speculation
about preordination is idle waste of .time,
is the only wise one; but how difflcuTE it
is not to speculate. My theology is a
simple muddle; I cannot look at the uni
verse as a result of blind chance, yet I
can see no evidence of beneficent design,
or Indeed of design of any kind In the
details. As for each variation bavin*
been preordained for a special end, I can
no more believe In It than that the spot
on which each raindrop falls has been
specially ordained."
To any one interested In the develop
ment of science, every letter in the two
volumes has something of instruction.
Even casual readers will find a fund of
entertainment In the familiar interchange
of thought among men of such eminence
and no one will have occasion to grudgs
the time spent in reading what was writ
ten either by Darwin or by his friend*..
beast was so large it could not enter the
door of the ark, and yet such an expla
nation was actually put forth by a mas
of eminence as a means of combating
what was called "T>arwinlsm." In Dar
win's own family the doctrine of the sur
vival of the fittest was soon familiar even
to the children. A story is told of one of
them saying' to his father: "If every one
would kill adders they would come to
sting less." Darwin replied "Of course
they would, for there would be fewer."
The child re-plied Indignantly: "I do not
mean that: but the timid adders which
would run away would be saved, and in
time they would never sting at all."
Darwin's use of the phrase, "natural
selection." gave rise to a good deal of
confusion and put the supporters of his
doctrine at a disadvantage In the con
troversy with their opponents.' and Wal
lace wrote urging him to adopt the term
of Herbert Spencer, "the survival of the
fittest." In advocating the change Wal
lace wrote: "This term Is a plain ex
pression of the fact. 'Natural selection'
is a metaphorical expression of it. and
to a certain degree indirect and incor
rect, since, even personifying nature, she
does not so much select special variations
as exterminate the most unfavorabls
ones." In reply Darwin stated that had
he received Wallace's argument on th«
point earlier he would have mads use of
Spencer's phrase, but the revised edition
of his book was then ready for publi
cation and it was too late to alter it. Ha
then went on to say: "As in time tha
term must grow intelligible, the objec
tions to its use will become weaker and
weaker."
CARNEGIE'S gift of $1,500,000 for the erection of a courthouse and library, a temple of
peace, as a permanent home of the Hague High Court of Arbitration, will doubtless have
the effect of giving the court a permanent existence as an international institution. There is
a certain force in property that tends to conservatism. Mankind does not" willingly
.let anything die that has a stately and enduring hefrne. A noble building impresses the imagination
and the memory. Residents of the locality take a pride in it. Visitors delight to inspect it and to
talk of it when they return to their homes. ]n that way the building adds to the fame and dignity
of the organization that maintains it. and so tends to increase at once its prestige and its vitality.
It is a foregone conclusion that when once the Temple- of Peace is completed it will be one of
the most noted show places in Europe. The possession of a famous home will moreover incline the
members of the Hague Court to hold assemblies more frequently Jhan they would otherwise do, and
accordingly the court will be more prominently before the public and exert a more constant and a
Called into existence by a Czar representing the mightiest of the surviving despotisms of the
earth, and gifted with a magnificent palace home by the generosity of a man who represents the
democracy of American labor, opportunity and law, the High Court will go down to future genera
tions as fairly representative of the age that created it and of the forces now in operation. America
and Russia stand as its sponsors. Despotism and democracy have united to uphold it. A vast field of
work lies before it, and it is not impossible it may grow to be an institution of first-class power in the
world of the future.
>Vj*& By the forces of steam and electricity the nations of the earth have been drawn so closely to
gether and their relations' Jiave been so interwoven in a common warp and woof that to-day the
affairs of far-off Manchuria in the wilds of Northeastern Asia are matters of public and popular con
cern to both Europe and America. So also the industrial and commercial conquest of South America
and of. Africa is bringing far separated nations into alliances 'or agreements for joint action. These
problems of international relations will increase in frequency as the commercial conquest goes on.
The higher interests of humanity will not admit of their settlement by war, for that would mean the
beginning of an era of conflict that would not terminate until the globe had been brought under the
virtuaf*dominatioii of a single power. By one means or another. solution for most' of the conflicting
interests of. the nations will have to be arranged by negotiation, and in that work the Hague Court,
if properly directed, will have an ever increasing authority and power.

Strangest Bridges in the* World.
What is this wonderful substance called
radium that science is talking so much
about? "We only know it, as we know all
other matter, by its manifestations.
According to its discoverer and Sir Wil
liam Crookes, it is a substance which ra
diates heat indefinitely. But it is so val
uable that a ton of it would pay the whole
national debt of Great Britain.
A bit as big as a grain of sand sends out
rays enough to blister the skin.
Radium is supposed in some mysterious
way to govern the motions of the uni
verse.
It has been isolated in minute quantles
with the most wonderful results. It is
the latest scientific puzzle.
But it is found in such small quantities
that it cannot be cornered for profit It
will never- be quoted in the Stock Ex
change. Let us be thankful.-Boston
Globe.
What Radium Is.
Another extraordinary property of ra
dium is to throw off rays rot only of heat,
but of light like those of the "glowworm
or firefly. Indeed, the light rays of ra
dium are so powerful that It has been sug
gested by French scientists that in this
rnyeteriouB metal may some day.be found
a means of lighting cities without loss of
energy or waste of force. The ray« of
It alto emits ray* that have the quali
ties of the X-ray and of cathodlc rays,
and is as active in vacuum as in the open
air. Its rays are analagous to those of
thorium and uranium, but incomparably
more intense. Its rays penetrate through
certain opaque bodtive filmg inclosed "*ln wooden boxes to
take impressions of metallic objects inter
posed as in case of the Roentgen rays.
The radiations from radium also react
chemically and physically on certain oth
er bodies, changing oxygen into ozon», for
instance, and the colors of glass or por
celain to dark violet or brown.
They found, further, -that radium main
tains its own temperature at a point 1.5
degrees centigrade above its surround
4nge, which is equivalent to saying that
the actual quantity of luat evolved is
such that the pure radium salt will melt
more than its own weight of Ice every
hour, and helf'a pound of radium will
evolve in one hour heat equal to that pro
duced by burning one-third of a cubic
foot of hydrogen gas. Yet despite this
constant activity the salt remains at the
end of months just as potent as ever.
The newly discovered metal, radium,
continues to be the subject of interesting
study and experiment on the part of both
chemists and physicists. Professor Curie
and Mme. Curie, the discoverer. In a late
communication to the French Academy
«if Sciences, stated that radium possesses
the extraordinary property of continuous
ly emitting heat without any chemical
charge of any kind, and without any
change in Its molecular structure, which
remains spectrcscoplcally identical afier
many months.
This multiple image, with the magnified
imaEC of a portion of the beetle's eye
usfd in making it. is given with his arti
cle, also full directions for taking the
picture and developing the plates.
The picture of the apparatus used in
making the above experiments is given
herewith. Bfiflfi
When first removed the crystalline tens
of a bullock's eye is a beautiful, clear
double convex lens about three-quarters
of an inch in diameter. It is soft end
delicate and must be handled with great
care to prevent its being injured. The
method of handling, mounting and using
the lene in photographic work is fully set
forth in the article. Stress Is laid on the
fact that the lens must be kept moistened,
as the cornea of the living eye is kept
moistened by the eyelid, and that the
aymous humor of the eye was found Ltst
suited for that purpose.
The cornea^ lenses of an insect's eye,
being very minute, were found quite diffi
cult to use in photography, but neverthe
less Professor Watson succeeded in get
ting some very clear and remarkable re
sUts therewith. The eyes of a single
btetle of some species have as many as
21.000 lenses, and each lens produces a
separate image of the object, making
therefore as many images as there are
lenses. Mr. Watson took a very small
w,iCtJon of a beetle's eye and mounting it
q-& his instrument as he describes got a
multiple image reproduction of a man's
head of over one hundred figures.
UNDER the UUe "Photographic Ex
periments With Nature's Lenees"
a recent Scientific American has
a very interesting article describing the
methods pursued in making photographs
with the crystalline lenses of bullocks'
and beetles' eyes, together with a number
of illustrations, some of which are here
reproduced.
The eyes of animals possess various dc
i-ices for the refraction of light and the
'ormation of images on the retina, the
rrystalline lens and the cornea appearing
to be the most important of these.
With the crystalline lens from a bul
lock's eye mounted in a pasteboard pill
box pierced with holes top and bottom
to serve as diaphragms Mr. Watson macic
a number of photographs which would
pass n-lth credit for the work of a good
K'.ass lens. Two of these pictures are
here reproduced, one of a wasp and the
other of a flea.
"Physicists do not doubt that the phe
nomenon observed by the Curies, ha3 a
cause and the investigation of that cause
is regarded as being full of promise for
the future."
Two German physicists. Runge and
Precht. have been studying the relations
of radium to the other elements with a
view to determining to what chemical
group i» belongs and what is its position
h. the so-called "periodic system," into
which all the elements have been ar
ranged.
They have already found that the most
intense lines of the spark spectrum of ra
dium are exactly analogous to the strong
est lines of barium and to the correspond
ing lines of its congeners, magnesium,
calcium and strontium. The atomic
weight of radium is now given at 257.8, a
much greater value than that assigned by
its discoverer, Mme. Curie.
radium dash and explode like minute ar
tillery projectiles upon sensitive surfaces,
and their phosphorescent properties are
astounding. The most puzzling property
of radium is that, as far as has yet been
ascertained, its properties of emitting
heat and light are inexhaustible. The
great mystery is how and where the am
bient forces needed to produce heat and
light are absorbed by radium. According
to the laws of the conservation and cor
relation of forces, heat, light and motion
are convertible, and neither Professor nor
Mme. Curie, nor Sir William Crookes, nor
any of the scientists of France, England
or Germany who have followed in Profes
sor Curie's footsteps, has yet been able
to prove that the incessant continuity in
the emission of rays of light and heat
from radium causes any exhaustion,- ex
penditure or diminution of the properties
so mysteriously stored in apparently in
finite quantities in this extraordinary,
metal.
Radium, moreover, has startling effects
upon the nervous centers of human be
ings ar.d living: animals. A glass tubo
containing one or two milligrams of radi
um when carried in the walstcoa't pocket
causes a painful wound in the flesh that
win require six months to heal. A glass
tube containing a few milligrams of ra
dium when Introduced beneath the skin
of a moufe near the vertebral column
produced death by paralysis in three
hours. Tubes of radium placed in contact
with the back of the necks of guinea pigs
kill or paralyze the animals in a few
hours, according to the length of expo
bure to its fatal radiations. M. Curie
snys that death to man would probably
ensue upon entering a room containing a
pcund of radium. Radium is, indeed, an
unknown quantity. Each week brings to
light startling additions to its mysterious
properties, which, as far as is yet known,
emanate and originate in itself.
"The world is thus made acquainted,"
says the report alluded to above, "with
a heat sufficient to raise the mercury in
a thermometer 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, the
output of which is maintained Indefinite
ly without any visible compensation to the
heat giving substance.
PUBLIC lnterset in the services ren'
dered to science by Charles Dar
win is attested by the fact that,
notwithstanding "the publication of his
"Life and Letters" in 1SS7, it has been
found advisable to publish two additional
volumes of biographical matter under the
title, "More Letters of Charles Darwin."
The new compilation is hardly less in
teresting than the former, for the letters
cover the whole period of. the long con
troversy over the doctrine of evolution,
ar.d Include parts of correspondence with
such men as Sir Joseph Hooker, Sir
Charles Lyell, Asa Gray, Fritz Muller.
John Morley, T. H. Huxley, the Duke of
Argyle, Francis Galton, Herbert Spencer
and Alfred Rus3ell Wallace. A consider
able number of letters, from those gen
tlemen to Darwin are also included in the
volumes, so that the work is a valuable
contribution not o the life of Darwin
only, but to a critical period of the his
tory of science from. 1S40 to 1SS2.
Perhaps the most interesting feature of
the book is a short sketch by Darwin of
his childhood. It was written in 183S and
was evidently designed as a record of his
early development, intended not for pub
lication, but for the reading of some fa
miliar friend, for the references to vari
ous persons are made without explana
tion, evidently upon the assumption that
the reader would know them well enougli.
In the course of the paper, which was
nevhasty sketch, Darwin shows that he
studied his early development with as
much scientific interest as any other sub
ject that engaged his attention.
He notes in the first place that his
earliest recollection is of an incident that
happened when he was 4 years old. Sit
ting one day on 'the lap of his sister,
who was cutting an orange, he was
startled by a cow going past the window,
which made him jump suddenly, so that
he received a bad cut, the scar of which
remained all his life. Of the scene Dar
win says: "I recollect the place where I
sat and the cause of the fright, but not
the cut itself. My memory here is an ob
scure; picture, in which from not recol
lecting any pain, I am scarcely conscious
of its reference to myself."
Another incident of his early childhood
shows that even in comparative infancy
his powers of observation had begun to
develop, for after recalling that he re
members going once to a shop in which
a man gave him a fig, that to his delight
turned out to be two figs, he adds: "This
fig was given me that the man might
kiss the maid servant." A recollection of
that kind shows that grown people
should be careful of young scientists, for
there is no telling how far they observe
facts and how capable they are of de
ducing conclusions from them.
From the time he was 8 years old his
recollections cease to be'obscure pictures
and become quite clear. Of that period
of his life he says:
"I remember how much afraid I was
of meeting the dogs in Barker street and
how at school I could not get up my cour
age to fight. I was very timid by nature.
I remember I took great delight in fish
ing for newts in the quarry* pool. I had
thus young formed a strong taste for cel
lecting seals, franks, pebbles and miner
als. I believe shortly after this I had
smattered in botany, and certainly when
at Mr. Case's school I was very fond of
gardening and invented some great false
hoods about being 'able to color crocuses
as I liked. It was soon after I had begun
collecting stones, that Is when 9< or 10,
that I distinctly recollect the desire I had
of being able to know something about
every pebble in front of the hall door. It
-was my earliest and only geological as
piration at that time. I was in those days
a very great story teller for the pure
pleasure of exciting attention and sur
prise. I scarcely ever went out walking
without saying "I had seen a pheasant or
some strange, bird. I recollect Inventing
a whole fabric to show how fond I was
of speaking the truth. I do not remem
oer any mental pursuits excepting thosa
of collecting stones and: gardening; and
about this time often going with my fath
er in his carriage, telling him of my les
sons and seeing game and other wild
birds, which "was a great delight to me.
I was a born naturalist."
Such' was the childhood of the great dls
cevcrer of the methods by which the
processes of evolution are carried on. It
is to be regretted that the sketch is v*
brief. A scientific study of the lntellec
tuar development of Darwin written by
himself it-is evident' would have been a
masterpiece. The frankness and sincer
ity with which this fragment is written
ls~a convincing proof that a complete au
tobiography would have been a genuine,
human document of the first importance,
both'to science andXto literature.
The letters relating. to the controversy
over the theory of evolution will appear
to readers of our time .as something like
emanations from the days of troglodytes.
It will be with something of amazement
that readers will learn that the opponents
o£ evolution went so far as to explain the
extinction of the mastodon by saying the
THE idea that work is a curse, put upon man for the Edenic transgression, and uttered in the
phrase: "Cursed is. the ground for thy sake; in the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat bread,"
surely does not apply to modern man. Work is the blessing that produces all blessings. In
work is health, and in health is happiness. Wealth is an incident, and "by itself is not the
<:ause of happiness. In its pursuit often health and happiness are sacrificed, and are lamented when
they* are gone beyond recovery. In work is length of days, the opportunity to apply experience and to
teach the true philosophy of life to those who are to follow. "The world, owes me a living," is the
vicious motto of laziness and unthrift. The world owes man only what he earns, by his hands, his
head or his genius.
President Roosevelt is the American apostle of work. His own life is an example of- work,
that all of his countrymen may well follow. In this he is not singular, for he shares his vigor of
thought and action with a vast majority of his countrymen. But it is well that a citizen in his sta
tion should frequently emphasize the gospel of work, in his address to the Y. M. C. A. at Kansas
City he did this in plain and impressive fashion. He said "Nothing can be done with a man who
will not work. We have in our scheme of government nq_room~for the man who does not .wish to
pay his way through life by what he does. A rich man is bound to work in some way that will make
the community better for his existence.- Capacity for work is absolutely. necessary, and no man can
be said to. live in the true sense of the word if he do not work."
That may be studied with profit by the social philosophers who continually present work as
a curse, which men should escape by some plan that will divert all of their time and energy to what
that school calls "improvement of the mind."
The best results of thought have come from physical work and not from physical idleness.
Work is the means and the beginning of all reform of the vicious. In penology it is hopeless to lead
men back to virtue except by honest work, which would have kept them virtuous. The prison statis
tics of all nations show that a very great majority of convicts had in freedom learned no calling
that would yield them an honest living. They acquired no skill with head or- hands to .earn their
bread, and naturally sought to get it by dishonestly preying upon the labor of pothers. But few skilled
mechanics are guilty of crimes against property or person. The idle are the recruits of the ranks' of
crime. True, there are those who see in the idleness of men the elysium of the race, but such a con
dition would be intolerable to a majority of men, and, immersed in it, the race would rapidly dete
riorate and fall from the high estate to which it has been lifted by work.
The President is correct in his inclusion of the rich' in the general obligation of all to work.
There is no more vicious example than that which is set by the idle rich. They are a class who, as a
rule, have inherited the accumulations of the honest toil and enterprise of their ancestors who were
workers, and they use it like drones in the human hive. Instead of being active stewards of their in
heritance, and using it so that it may supply work to others, and in its administration make work
for themselves; they make it pander to their selfish indulgence and set an example of idleness which
makes them the teachers of evil to their fellow-men. What people are who do not feel the spur of
necessity to work may be seen in the tropics, where nature does not impel to toil, and where even the
hardiest races soon degenerate, lose their arts and theii; energy and cease to be an influence in the on
ward movement of the world.
Without^ work there is no true leisure, no grateful rest, no satisfying sleep. Those who dream
of life as one long holiday dream of it deprived of its zest and its pleasure. Rest is the reward of
toil, and otherwise has no- significance and no satisfaction.
When the President is extolling the pioneers who won the West he is preaching the gospel
of labor, for the virtue of the pioneer was that he must earn before he could eat or be slieltered. Let
the idea be enforced that each generation is made up of the pioneers of life. No matter, under what
conditions, they begin as the frontiersmen of their career. For them the ground is not cursed but
blessed, and the bread thev eat, earned in the sweat of their faces, is the real bread of life.</text>

V/y l.cr.ored riddle Is looked
upon as extremely foolish,
but after i"« the subject hae two sides
to it. for t:-.» r"f»e^t inclination among
j'Kcicntisis Is to hold that the egg came
Jlrst. It used to V>e thought that every
form of lite en this earth was an ob
j Jcct of special creation which had
t descended uncharged from the Garden
'\u25a0' oZ "dm. This is not now bplieved by
cay o=e vrho g-ives the matter any in
tt'ligcnt thought, for the simple rea
cor» that new breeds cf cattle and do
mestic animals are constantly being
produced by the expert breeder, and
j In the floral kir.rrdom some really re
markablc innovations have been ob
j tamed by horticulturists.
2Co matter what we may believe of
evolution In general, it is absurd to
think of an Angora cat purring at
the feet of Mother Eve, of bantam eggs
cooked for Adam's breakfast, or a
group of American Beauty roses adorn
i ing his table. These and many other
breeds which are really distinct species
we know to have been developed by
man in comparatively recent years
through proper selection and cross
breeding. It is l|ut natural to sup
pose that the same selection and cross
breeding might occur in nature wlth
\u25a0 out the aid of man, and thus be the
origin* of the myriads of species which
fill this earth. And if this be so why
could not genuses be similarly orlgi
nated, for the difference between spe
j cies ar.d genus is not clearly defined.
The ss.me is true of all classifications,
So that if we admit a new genus can
(thus be formed, we cannot logically
draw the line at families, orders or
even kingdoms.
These ideas are not new. Even some
of the ancient Greek philosophers held
J that all life sprang originally from a
j bmmon origin: but it was Charles
Darwin who advanced the first logical
I theory accounting for the development
of the various gcrnif from the. primal
t germ, and he established his theory by
a. most comprehensive array of facts
gathered from all parts of the world.
New Creation Theories.
\u25a0 Darwinism met with religious op
position almost as bitter as that which
assailed Copernicus -when he first de
iclared that the world was not flat, but
round. In recent years, however, we
have come to realize that the Biblical
story of the creation should not be
j literally interpreted any more than
f certain other parts of the Bible and
that the idea of creation covering
•millions of years and accomplished
I jtritbout violating the laws by which
nature is now governed is not*one whit
less marvelous or divine than a crea
tlon in six literal days.
Darwin did not claim that the breed
log or evolving of new species in na
j ture was conducted in a haphazard
fashion, but that it was governed by a
law, workir.gr toward the constant bet
i terment of the Fpeojps. This law he
called natural selection, or as Herbert
Spencer termed it. "the survival of the
fittest." and it may be briefly explained
las follows: All nature Is at war. Ti*e
animal kingdom preys on the vegetable
kingdom, and the vegetable kingdom
in turn, chiefly in the form of bacteria,
preys on the animal kingdom. Aside
from this there is extensive civil war
within the animal kingdom. Mammals.
birds, reptiles, fish and insects all are
constantly battling with one another.
In the vegetable kingdom also there is
a .civil war. the stronger and hardier
plants overpowering the weaker ones
and choking them. We little realise
how fearful is thi« struggle about us.
It has been estimated that, taking
en average of all forms of life, 999 in
j dlvlduGls out of every 1000 die an un
natural or violent death. Were this
not so the earth would not be large
enough to contain all the life that
*rould b* produced at the end of a few
years. A single pair of almost any
animal If exactly adapted to its sur
rounding* and not Interfered with in
any way, would in a comparatively few
jreneratlons overrun the earth. Ele
phants are the slowest breeders we
know, yet it has been estimated that if
every offspring- were permitted to reach
maturity the living descendants of a
single pair would, at the end of 750
years, number 19,000,000 individuals.
Universal -warfare is thus absolutely
necessary to keep the living world
•within bounds. Now the theory of nat
ural selection holds that only those
Individuals best fitted for the battle
of life stand a chance of surviving.
Generation after generation this war
hn* wasred. ar.d nature has been killing
off all those that vrere unfitted to hold
th«ir own. co that eventually races have
been evolved which are admirably
•idapted to their surro-Jndlnge.
Some animals have earned their
right to a plsr? in t>.e life of this
world by developing sreat strength.
Others owe their existence to the de
velopment of high speed in getting
away from their en*iai*.s. An example
of the latter class is the horse, which
now has but one toe to each foot,
whereas fossil remclns Indicate* that
the present horse has gradually
evolved from a horse having five toes.
This evolution is due to the \u2666hoe* animals which rose on their toes
succeeded best in running away from
their enemies. The middle. to«t was
thus brought most, into action, and nat
'tiral selection encouraged its develop
ment at the expense of the otner toes,
which were gradually lost.
A large part of the animal world
owes it« survival to the fact that it
bears co close a resemblance to its
surroundings that it cannot be readily
discovered by its enemies. One of the
most Interesting examples of this is
Surnlshed by the kalllma butterfly,
•whidi 1« found In India. This butterfly
is very brilliantly marked, with bands

edge of the wings is indented In a
manner resembling a damaged Jeaf.
Strangely enough, the wings of those
butterfliea, which are bred in the fall,
have a reddish hue corresponding to
the color of fall leaves. It is said that
Portuguese explorers of early days
brqught home the story of a peculiar
tree which in a windstorm sheds Its
leaves, but that after, the storm the
leaves flew back to their places on the
tree. These animated leaves were
doubtless the kallima butterfly. An
other odd Insect, ls the "walking stick,"
which bo resembles twig that it eas
ily, escapes notice. The oranee-tlnped
butterfly Is usually found among .the
Rowers of the mustard plant, of which
in the matter of color it Is an exact,
copy. The "hickory horned devil" is
an example of another kind of protec
tion. This catorplllar Is very large,
sometimes half a foot or more in
length, and its liorns give it really a
most ugly appearance, whereas It is
really a very harmless individual.
Xow, according to Darwin's theory
of evolution, tl>es<»- characteristics have
been gradually developed by natural
selection in gereration after genera
tion. That Is, those butterflies which
most closely resemble loaves and those
caterpillars which develop the most
terrifying aspect stood the best show
of survivinr. while the poorer Imita
tions were discovered by tneir enemies
and devoured. The same selection tonic
place in the next generation rind the
next, and so on, until. tve now have, an
almost perfect imitation. Thlsl. how
ever, docs not mean that the butter-
fly's battle is now over, for, according
to the theory, its enemies in their
search for food have become more and
more keen and better able to detect
the differences between the butterfly
and the leaf.
This theory of natural selection ls
very good as far as it goes, "but re-,
cently new ideas have sprung up. Dar- j
win's theory required thousands of
generations to form a new snecles,
whereas new breeds are artificially de
veloped in f very few years.. The orl-.

are employed by nature. If a fancier
should try to produce a new breed by \u25a0
selecting those SDecles .which showed;

desired breed the bhances are that h«
would be no nearer his Roal at the end

It «was 'late afternoon when we left
to produce butterflies ranging tn col

something to do with the origin of
species. But these species are not
fixed, because the Arctic 'varieties he
produced changed back to those of the
temperate lone when bred at moderate
temperatures, or to those of the tropics
when bred at extreme heat, and vie*
versa., In one case, however, he claims
to have actually produced a species by
abnormal temperature which bred true
under normal conditions. Experiments
similar ;to those of Standfuss are be
ing carried out by Dr. P. T. Macdou&al.
director of the department of botanical
research of the Carnegie Institution.
He has grown the same plant at sea
level and at altitudes of 230.0. 5000, 6000
and 8000 feet, and produced widely
varying" forms. But. none. of these are
fixed, for they will revert to the parent
type .when returned to their, original
environment. Hhwever. "he Is trying
the experiment of fixing the species by
breeding: the plants at these altitudes
for. a great many generations.

from a hose, the contact of the nozzle
or of the spout of the sprinkler; the
careless brushing of the sleeve or the
hand against the dirt may result in the
transference of seeds and the vitiation
of .years, of; labor and care, especially
If a complicated series of tests fa under

Breeding Artificial Flowers.
Dr. MacdQupal has already obtained
some very remarkable results in a thor
oughly original line of investigation.
He han tried the" experiment of inject
ing\ weak solutions of various chemi
cals •In the ovary- of a flower called
ralmanniii odorata Just before, the
flower opened. The flower was then
covered with a bag of oiled paper to
keep out insects or floating pollen of
other plants. From the -se^ds of a
flower thus-treated he obtained a num
ber of individuals which differed very
materially from the parent. These new
types have bred true and they are th<*
first species ever produced with the a!d
of artificial means. The same experi
ment was tried with the common even-
Ing primrose, and this also gave rise
to a new species. To explain hoY
such conditions could arise In nature.
Mr. Macdougal suggests that the atlnc
Of an Insect" might Introduce ?luij3
which' would affect the ovules In such
a way as to produce a mutant. The re
sult might also be obtained by the ac
cidental entrance of pollen from a plant
of a different genus. The pollen might
be carried by the wind or by beet and
other insects Into the open flower.
Owing to the great difference in the
two plants a, hybrid \u25a0 would not be
formed, but the effect of foreign po'len
In the ovary, might be such as to stim
ulate certain properties .and thus bring
about .the production of a mutant.
A very -plausible explanation of the
production of mutants In plants has
thus been found. Animal variations, on
the .other hand, are more difficult to
studV.
Just how the same results couM be
obtained In the higher order of animal
life It not clear. It Is possible that we
may learn some day Just how to modify
and develop certain characters of the
human body. We m«y be able, for In
stance, to eliminate criminal tendencies
or to develop a highly Intellectual peo
ple of most beautiful form. But at
present .such speculations are Idle.
What we have learned Is that new
species do come from mutants, and that
mutants can be originated by chemical
agencies. Whether the species could
be produced by natural selection with
out the origin of the sport, as Darwin
claims, we cannot definitely state, for
Darwia's theory requires tens of thou
sands of years for the formation of a
Mingle species, whereas man's life ts but
four score years and ten. However, the
evidence* we \u25a0 do have seem ..to be
against, Darwin's teachings, and. to re
turn to our original question of th*
owl and the eg*, recent investigations
seem to prove that the egg came first:
for It must have been a mutant of some

at the' perfecting of those theories until, after almost a wholo

to the South Seas. This gave him his start On his return to England bf

This, In brief. Is the much discussed '"Theory of Evolution. Most peo
ple think Darwin Invented It no did not Lamarck set forth tha theory, In
a halting fashion, nearly ten years before Darwin was born. But Darwin
laid hold of Lamarck's Incomplete Idea and worked It out conclusively lm
proving on it and building it up and changing it' until he had made It
his own.
For twenty years or ao he continued his researches, surmounting every
obstacle, sometimes taking many months to clear up a single knotty point,
taking no forward step until all preceding steps wero too firm to bo shaken.
it was a tremendous labor, and it was carried on in the face of a whirlwind
of discouragement But Darwin never wayered. Ho was making good and
he had the genius to know It and the iron perseverance to stick to his self
appointed labor.
At last he published the book "Origin of Species," which contained the
fruits of his long years' researches and experiments.
By way of reward nearly every scientist on earth denounced him as a
crank or a faker. Ho was assailed In press and
t Denounced as a T pnlplt Undeterred by this avalanche'of censur,

	<text>EVOLUTION
Dr. Ganvllle Lowther.
About 50 years ago Charles Dar-
Iwln, the world's greatest naturalist
and Herbert Spencer, the world's
greatest philosopher, announced
their belief In the theory of evolu
jtlon as an explanation of the order
of the universe. It startled chrls
tlans and was opposed with a logic
learning, eloquence and wit per
haps unequaled by any discussions
of the past. It was an age when
the rack, the gibbet, the cross and
any other form of physical punish
ment for opinion's sake had passed
away, and the appeal was made to
reason. After fifty years of the most
careful scrutiny, the severest crit
icisms, the most eloquent and learn
ed discussions, by the best scholars
on both sides, it has won Its way intc
literature, college text books, lec
tures, -sermons and the thought of
the masses, so that but few who lay
Just claim to scholarship deny the
truth of its claims and the effort
now is to harmonize the facts of na
ture and the experiences of life with
j its teachings. The evolutionists
1 themselves are not agreed as to their
i theories. It is true of them as
diaries Darwin taught of the strug
i gles of the various forms of life on
j the earth for existence, "The strug
i gle is greatest among the individ
uals of the same kind; because they
subsisting on the same food and liv
ing under the same conditions, come
ilnto more direct contact and there
fore direct conflict, with each other
for the same things." This is true
of the various denominations of the
I Christian church. It has been ob
served in a majority of cases where
there is in any city or country a
sharp competition or rivalry between
denominations of Christians, that
I those most alike were the greatest
rivals. So it has been with the ad
Jvocates of evolution. They have dl
jvided into three schools of thought
iviz: Atheistic, who eliminated God
from the idea of the universe, Deis
tic, who believe in God, believe that
He created all things and that evo
lution was His mode of operation
but believe that after calling the
primary substances Into being, and
placing them under certain laws, He
left them to work out their destiny
without interference of guidance;
Thelstlc, who believe in God, be
lieve that all material things are
expressions of His life, energy and
thought, that He is In them and
clothes Himself with them and that
their movements under what we call
natural law are His modes of oper
ation. It is this theory of evolu
tion that we will in a series of ar
ticles discuss. We do not care to
discuss the Atheistic nor the Dels
tic, but to set forth the arguments
that are generally relied on for he
support of evolution in general and
then for Theistic evolution. I
The arguments used for the sup
port of evolution are from the var
ious branches of science. They come
from the generally accepted facts
classified under the general heads
of biology, geology, embryology,
eoology, astronomy, physiology, an
thropology, bibliology, history and
sociology.
The principal laws In operation
jare (1) all life struggles for expres
sion. (2) There is In all forms of
I life a struggle for existence. (3)
In the struggle for existence there
will be the survival of the fittest; in
other words, the survival of the best
'adapted to Its environments.
In the survival of the fitest, the sur
vlval of the unfit Is Impossible. This
occurs because there is not room
or food for all that comes Into being
and only that which ls best adapted
Ito the conditions of life can live
(5) The above facts are responsible
for what we call nature's law of
selection and rejection. (6) In all
the individuals of any species there
is a tendency to variation. This var
iation is often in size as in case
where one Is better fed than anoth
er. It may be in color, as is some
times seen the nature of the food Is
changed. It Is seen ln the thick
ness of the skin or the color of the
hair as a result of climate. There
are also changes of texture .chemi
cal changes in blood, sap and juices
of the body on account of soil, water
and the mental states of animals
These and other facts, It is argued
make evolution possible. Tbe ques
tion then arises, is it probable? In
the answer to this question may be
found the evidences from nature as
seen ln the various fields of invest!
gat ion. in the phenomena of the un
Iverse. The first that we shall pre
sent is from
BIOLOGY.
We can only give a summary, or
brief of the arguments that have
taken volumes to amplify; but as
we read and understand them they
are as follows: Biology teachea
that the many forms of life have
primarily one substance. This sub
stance is called protein. It is com
posed of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen
and nitrogen. This when united
with a large -proportion of water
forms the chief constituent of the
substance known as protoplasm,
which Is the physical basis of all
forms of life. It is not life, but It
is the primary forfn in which all life
is clothed. This life Is constantly
changing on account of a process of
organization of material particles
with which It clothes Itself, and the
disintegration of particles by which
it tends to death. One is the build
ing up process and the other the
tearing down process, both of which
are continually going on. Every
particle of food builds fiber or tis
sue, and every movement tears them
down. If the reconstructive process
ts more rapid than the destructive
process, there is growth. If it is
less, there is decline. In youth the
reconstructive proees is greater; In
age it is less. Therefore the tenden
cy of all living matter is toward cy.
eli-changes. All living matter pro
ceeds from pre-existent living mat
ter. A portion of the old being de
tached and the new taking on the
form of the old, with certain modi
fications. These modifications are
from numerous causes. some of
which have already been named, viz,
quantity and quality of food, cli
mate, soil, water, mental states of
animal life and many other condi
tions classified mainly under the
laws of heredity and environment.
It is therefore the belief of the
biologist that the many forms of
life had originally one form, viz
protoplasm, and that the tendency
has been. Is now and ever will be
toward higher and still higher
forms.
In another article I will give the
arguments from other branches of
science, no one of which would be
regarded of itself as -sufficient proof;
but when they are all taken togeth
er form an argument that ls almost
Irresistable.

<text>Ideas Medieval, and Bryan He
Classes as “Eloquent
Ignoramus”
By WILLIAM R. CURRY,
International News Service,
CHICAGO, June 19.—With the
date of the trial of John T. Scopes,
Tennessee school teacher, on
charges of teaching evolution con
trary to State law drawing near,
the question of evolution has be
come a burning issue in scientific
and (educational circles.
And among the latest to demand
a hearing is Doctor John M. Coul
ter, head of the Department of
Botany in the University of Chi
cago. Doctor Coulter takes a fling
at both Charles Darwin and Wil
liam Jennings Bryan.
••Why, Darwin is a. back num
ber,” the Chicago biologist said.
“He belongs back in the Middle
Ages himself. x
“As for Bryan, I notice that
whenever I use the phrase ‘elo
quent ignoramus/ there is no con
fusion in any one’s 'mind as to who
is meant.”
Doctor Coulter indicated that he
finds Bryan’s constant refsrences
to Darwin wearying in the ex
treme.
He explained why he classifies
the popularizer of such phrases as
“natural selection** and 'the sur
vival of the fittest” as medieval.
“The idea of evolution io as old
as human thought itself and no
name of modern times can be asso
ciated as the author of it. Darwin
was merely one of many who at
tempted an explanation of the Idea.
Dozens of others, the poet Goethe
among them, were attempting the
same thing at the same time. But
Darwin was a good publicity get
ter and he caught the" popular
fancy.
“The history of evolution divides
itself into three periods,” Doctor
Coulter continued. “Evolution was
a meditation, an abstract theory,
until 1800. From 1800 to 1900, the
period of observation and inference,
it was first suggested that evolu
tion might be more than an idea,
that it- might be a scientific feet.
Since 1900, we have been engrossed
with experimentation, with
ing plants and animals under rigid
control. With the work of DeVries
in Holland, evolution became an
actual demonstration, not just an
Inference.
“Explanation of the oft-repeated
cry that biologists are abandoning
evolution lies in the feet that it is
true that all explanations offered
thus far are entirely inadequate to
explain the facts.
“No modern biologist doubts the
facts of evolution. They have been
demonstrated over and over again,
but never have been explained fully.
Different experiments explain dif
ferent phases, but none yet made
explains all.”

<text>What Darwinism Is.
Darwinism, says an exchange, refer
ring to the death of Charles Robert
Darwin, is one of the attempts to ex
plain the law or manner of evolution,
finding the cause of the differentiation
of species to lie in the struggle of the
organism to adapt itself to the constant
ly altering conditions oi its environ
ment. These conditions of external
life act on plants and animals in their
natural state with an effeot analogous
to that by which artificial cultivation or
breeding by man can change and im
prove the characteristics of the differ
ent domestio plants and animals. This
process of the operation of natural cir
cumstances, by whioh those varieties or
individuals best adapted to their sur
roundings of climate, station, character
of soil, food-supply and the number and
kind of living beings competing in the
"struggle for existence," are pre
served the longest in life, was called by
Mr. Darwin natural selection." But
he not only saw that the oonstant bat
tle for life going on among living crea
tures must be a winnowing and im
proving process, those least adapted to
the situation giving way before those
better adapted It was his
merit to discover that natural selection
is capable of producing fitness between
organism and their circumstances, and
of discerning the importance of the con
sequences that follow." From the al
most general admission of naturalists
that natural selection was potent in the
production of varieties in species, Mr.
Darwin went further, and held that one
species sprang from another, by a
long-continued process of Blow varia
tion and natural selection."</text>

<text>BRUIE FORCE THEORY
OF UFE DEMOUSHED
English Zoologist Contests
Carman Belief That the
Strongest Survives.
DARWINISM AND WAR
Chalmers Mitchell, in New
Book of That Title,
Talks of Biology.
(From the Scientific American Sup
plement.)
Chalmers Mitchell'* new book, "Du i
wlntent and War" (the writer is a dis
tinguished English zoologist) is a re
ply ti> the argument in favor of war, so
often put. forth In the last three years
liy a certain German school, that a state
of constant struggle or warfare is a
dominant factor in evolution. These
writers declare that war Is both neces
sary and admirable, and is in fact a
biological law which man cannot re
sist. and that it Is, moreover, benefi
cial in the long run, favoring the sur
vival of the strongest and ablest races
They remind us that all animals, and
even all plants, arc engaged in a con
stant battle for the necessities of life
for earth, air. food, water, and a place
in the sun,. H.o that it is natural and
inevitable that not only men but na
tions must'engage in the same rivalry,
which is a means of selection of the
fittest.
Merely Hypothesis.
Darwin, however, never stated this
principle as a biological law, but mere
ly as:a working hypothesis capable o;
explaining many facts otherwise ob
scure. Mr. Mitchell examines at length
various examples of the struggle for
existence among animals, such as tin
supplantihg of the thylacine, a marsu
pial aibout- .the size of a large fox, by
the dlhgo, or wild dog of Australia, the
nearly complete extermination of the
black:' rat by the bold and fierce brown
rat, Çtc. His conclusion is that the
causes which determine the success of
one species in relation to another are
variable and often difficult to deter
mine. Such success may be due to a
better developed brain, to a. greater re
sistance to microbes, or to a superior
capability of adaptation to environ
ment.' Btit he finds no evidence thal
violence exerted .by individuals of tin
more favored species upon individuals
of the less favored species is an im
portant factor. In his own words:
"Natural selection results from tin
conservation of favored races rather
than from the extermination o£ one
race by another."
Man Not Animal.
He contends, moreover, that there is
nn intpassable gulf between men and
animals residing in the fact that man
possesses the consciousness and sen
timent of liberty, and that he regulates
bis conduct by moral laws .elaborate'
through centuries. He finds nothing in
common between the grouping of indt
viduals which forms a modern nation
and that which constitutes a race 01
species of animals. In short, lie bc
believes it is entirely inadmissible to
attempt to justify human conduct by
laws supposèd to be dominant in tin
animal kingdom.
In his essay entitled "Biology and
War" Prof. Ktienno Rabaud of the
staff Of the Sorbonne points out the
alleged error of the Germans in con
sidering brute strength tin- preponder
ant factor of evolution, since there are
various possibilities which may pre
vent the victory of the strong over the
week. He writes:
Adversaries do not always encounter
each other under the same conditions,
and it often happens that the strong' r
or more skillful is badly placed and
therefore perishes. It is true that in
open territory, with only his own re
sources the chances arc against the
weaker, though Fie may at times escape
by flight. Even so, however, the weak
ness of the victim may be Silly rela
tive, as when a young individual of a
species better endowed with absolute
valor meets an udult of less endow
ment.
Circumstances Count.
Then it often happens that circum
stances prevent the individual appar
ently most advantaged from making
use of his advantages, and facilitate
the attack of bis less advantaged ene
my. Cope has expressed the
highly probably hypothesis that the
disappearance of the huge Jurassic
saurians was due to very small mam
mals, who. by destroying the eggs of
the former, destroyed the species.
Whether this hypothesis lie actually
true or pot, it expresses the essential
fact that absolute force is not domi
nant in biologic phenomena; force is
always relative, not only to the Individ
ual opponents, but to multiple contin
gencies, infinitely and constantly va
riable. Jliis relatively is nowhere more
true than among civilized human*|ic
clcs where the fate of the Strongest
always depends on occasion, on com
plex factors, on those- "impondérables"
of which there has been So much talk
apropos of the present war. Thtf
environment, the habits of 1 1 0-, the con
course of divers circumstances often
give to the weaker the complètent mas
tery. The inevitable strength is
not and could never be a biologic fact.</text>

<text>1)E VRIES' "MUIATION."
Orthodoxy received the most stun
ning blow ever given it, at the hands
of Charles Darwin, and it is ever on
the lookout for an opportunity to
make reprisals. It is only necessary
for some fledgling to challenge Dar
win's theory of the origin of coral
reefs and offer some grotesque as
sumption in its place, and it is at
once announced from a thousand pul
pits that Darwinism,-that enemy of
God and man-is dead.
HIugo DeVries, however, could
hardly be called a fledgling, and the
supporters of Darwin had real cause
for apprehension, it would seem,
when the rumor gained ground that
no less a person than the Amster
dam professor had overthrown Dar
win's theory, and substituted one of
his own.
Alas, this latest "death of Darwin
ism" was no more fatal than its
numerous predecessors, as the fol
lowing quotation from DeVries him
self will show:
"lily work claims to be in full ac
cord with the principles laid down
by l)arwin." And again, "To D)arwin
was reserved the task of bringing
the theory of common descent to its
present high rank in scientific and
social philosophy." And, "Notwith
standing all these apparently unsur
mountable difficulties, (absence of
experimental evidence since gather
ed) Darwin discovered the great
principle which ruiles the evolution
of organisms. It is the principle of
natural selection. It is the sifting
out of all organisms of minor worth
through the struggle for life."
The greater part of the adverse
criticism. aimed at Darwinism ap
plies only to the extravagant claims
put forward not to be found in the I
works of Darwin himself. As we
shall see later, one of the greatest
offenders in this respect was no less
a person than the co-discoverer of
the selection theory--Alfred Russell
Wallace."
Of all the mischievous misconcep
tions of Darwin's theory none have
worked so much harm as that which
regards natural selection as the ac
tive and efficient cause of evolution.
Although evolution is an estab
lished fact, our knowledge of its
processes are incomplete and imulst
always remnain so until we have
solved that most vexed of all biologi
cal problemls, the "causes of varia
tion."
As to the nature of these causes.
natural selection is dumb. For its
purpose, variation is simply assumed
to be a fact, and Darwin's acknowl
edged ignorance as to how variation
is brought about is expressed in the
term "spontaneous variation." Un
til variation has played its part by
producing new and various forms,
selection has no function or office to
perform. Then it simply decides
which forms shall survive by destroy
ing the rest. As Wigand has pointed
out, selection does not do miiore tlihan
determine the survival of what is of
fered to it, and does not create any
thing new. As DeVries very strik
ingly puts it, "it is onily a sieve, and
not a force of nature, ino dilrect caiis'
of imlproveuellnt, as mally of I)arwill's
adversaries, aild unfortunately many
of his followers also, have so often
asserted. It is only a sieve which
decides which is to live and which is
to die With the single steps
of evolution it has nothing to do.
Only after the step has been taken,
the sieve acts, eliminating the unfit."
MThus Prof. Cope's point that Dar
win's theodry does not explain the
"origin" of the fittest, is well taken,
or as Mr. Arthur Harris puts it, "Na
tural selection may explain the sur
vival of the fittest, but it cannot ex
plain the arrival of the fittest."
It was around this question of the
"causes" of variation that the Neo
Lamarckians and the Weismannians
fought their battle, the former in
sisting, as we have seen, that varia
tion was caused by the hereditary
transmission of acquired characters,
while Weismann maintained that
variation arose solely through the
comlbining of two portions of differ
ent individuals, and producing a new
individual unlike either,-a "varia
tion" from both. While whatever
there was of victory fell to Weis
mann, neither side has experimental
ly proven its case, and we are still in
the dark as to the "causes of varia
tion." Our ignorance is still cloaked
in the convenient word "spontane
ous;" to Darwin's "spontaneous va
riation" we now add DeVries' "spon
taneous mutation."
It is another tribute to Darwin's l
caution and insight that he recog
nized the possibility of variations:
arising either suddenly, as DeVriesI
asserts they do, or gradually as Doe
Vries denies.
Not only did Alfred Russell Wal-I
lace seek to limit the operation of;
natural selection in certain fields, in
order to make room for his spiritlnl-I
ist theories--an adventure which
failed disnally--but he denied the l
sudden appearance of new species or[
sub-species, thereby restricting Dar
winisum, as he understood it, to the
origin of new species by the gradual
accumulatlon of those almnost imper
ceptible variations usually described
as "fluctuations." WVhtever conflict
there may be hctween Darwinism and
miutation must be ascribed to 'Wal
lace. As DeVries clearly recognizes,
Darwin is in no way responsible.
"Darwin." says DeVries, "recognized
both lines of evolution."
The difference between "fluctua-I
tions" and "'nutation" is illustrated
by recalling Calton's simile of a poly
hedron-an example of which is al
on any particular face, it is in stable
equilibrium. Small disturbances may
make it oscillate, but it returns al-I
ways to lthe same face. These escil-l
litions are like fluctuating varia-1
iions. A gretaler disturbance mcay
cause lhb p1olyhedrlonl to roll over onll
to a new fact', where it comes to rest
again. only showing tIhe ever present
fluctuations aoelidiid the new centelr.
The new' position corresponds to a.
autation. One of the disabilities of
his illustration is that some fluctun
tions represent a greater disturbance)
i'om the given position than some I
mutations. The essential difference
s that in the fluctuation it rocks
back again while in the mutation it
emnains on a new base.

I!ev. Frank Pratt ?poke last nl?tht
at the l'nltarlan church upon "The
Processes ?f Kvolution This wa?
the fifth of hts course of lecture
sermons upon "The Principles and
Proofs of Kvolutlon" He said. In
part:
"Darwin's special contribution to'
evolution was his theory of the sur
vival of the fittest through natural
selection. Those who are not famil
iar with the principles f evolutior/
sometlnn s think that Darwinism sind
evolution are inter< hang'-able terms.
This Is far from the truth. Darwin
ism (natural selection) i? simply the!
ihlef means t which Darwin be
lieved evolution was accomplished.!
?ne may reject Darwinism and yet
believe fully in evolution.
"When you read in n paper or
magazine, 'Darwinism refuted by j
noted scientists.' do not think that it
is evolution which is doubted. It Is'
simply Darwin's theory of the survl- j
val of the fittest I y natural selection,
which is opposed The fact <>f evol'J-
t Ion is settled In the minds of all
the important scientists of the world, j
but there Is siill discussion as to the
processes of evolution.
"Furthermore, those who doubt
I'nrwlnism as a rule do not doubt
It as an important factor in di-vel
i pment, but they recognize that it
cannot explain all phases of evolu-
tion. Darwin himself said in his in
traduction to 'The Origin of Spe
cies': 'i am convinced Hint natural
selection has been the main, but not
the exclusive, means of modification.*
"Kven though tine may recognize
the important Influence that Darwin's
theory of natural selection through
the survival of the fittest has played
in development, one may also recog
nize that there are oilier processes
which encourage development. one
can easily see that there may come a
period of evolution when co-opera-'
tion in social groups, instead of;
struggle, will act as n great incentive
power towards development. There j
are still many mysteries in the pro
rtsses of evolution, although the fact
if evolution leaves a clear trail be
lli nd it.
It eln t lonsh I p Not Clear.
"The influence of environment, as
emphasized by the Xeo-I?amnrekists; I
the advance in the germ-plasm, as
believed in by Weismann anil his!
school, development by means of
more radical changes and sustained
by heredity as set forth by Mendel-'
ism ?these various processes may j
have played their various parts in the
great upward movement of life. 1 ut 1
Just what relationship these processes
hold to each other is not yet wholly
clear.
"To the average person the process
nf tile survival of the fittest, by nat-
ural selection, as set forth by Dar- j
win, is the simplest explanation of.
the general method of evolution. Dar-j
win's explanation starts out with the
fact that more animals are born than
can survive. If, for instance, ail
fishes were born and grew up in sic-
rordance with the number of eggs
laid, eventually the ocean would be
a solid mass of fish. More fish are
horn than can survive. Thus there is
n struggle to decide which shall live
and which shall pass away. In this
struggle for existence those which
luive the most favorable qualities i
survive.
"If a favorable quality comes Into j
rxlstence, this means an advantage j
which will tend to make ihc Individ- I
iial survive. These favorable varia
tions, if they are deep-seated enough,
lire transmitted to the offspring, ami
in tills way a favorable species Is
lirought Into being. This means the
survival of the fittest'?the littest for
the environment.
"In the study of the processes of
evolution one great fact must l.e con
stantly remembered. Ouislde influ
ences alone can never account for
the meaning of life in all Its vari
kiis forms. There Is an inner plan
mid purpose which has not been
